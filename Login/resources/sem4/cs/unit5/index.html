            <h2>What is Ratio?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A ratio is a way to compare two quantities by dividing them to find their simplest form. For
                    example:
                    <br>Given the numbers 1000 and 500, if we divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor
                    (GCD), we
                    get:
                    <br>2 : 1
                    <br>This means the ratio of 1000 to 500 is 2:1, indicating that 1000 is twice as much as 500.
                </li>
                <li>A ratio is a comparative term. For instance:
                    <br>If we have the numbers 1000 and 500, we may not immediately understand their relationship.
                    However,
                    when we express these numbers as a ratio, like 2:1, it becomes clear that 1000 is twice as much as
                    500.
                    Ratios are particularly useful in more complex comparisons.
                </li>
                <li>A ratio is not an actual value but a representation of the relationship between two quantities. For
                    example:
                    <br>If a recipe calls for a ratio of 2 cups of flour to 1 cup of sugar, it means that the amount of
                    flour is double the amount of sugar, regardless of the actual measurements used.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>a : b = 3 : 4 and b : c = 8 : 9<br>

                </pre>
                <p>We have 'b' as the common term in both ratios. <br> To find a common ratio that includes 'a', 'b',
                    and 'c', we need to make the value of 'b' the same in both ratios. <br> Currently, 'b' is 4 in the
                    first ratio and 8 in the second ratio. <br>To make 'b' the same, we can multiply the first ratio by
                    2:</p>
                <pre>
2 * (3 : 4) = 6 : 8
                </pre>
                <p>Now we have:</p>

                        Here we basically write the ratio in step-wise order and the spaces that are left are filled by
                        the nearest number available. Then, we multiply the column values and finally divide the ratio
                        by any GCD.

                    <li>Let's denote the cost of an apple by A and the cost of a mango by M.</li>
                    <li>Given the ratio of their prices: A / M = 3 / 4, which implies A = 3k and M = 4k for some

                    <li>We are given that the cost of 10 apples and 15 mangoes is Rs. 360: <br>
                        10A + 15M = 360</li>

                    <li>Substituting the values of A and M in terms of k: <br>
                        10(3k) + 15(4k) = 360<br>
                        30k + 60k = 360<br>
                        90k = 360<br>

                        M = 4k = 4 * 4 = 16<br>
                        Cost of 50 apples = 50 * 12 = 600<br>
                        Cost of 60 mangoes = 60 * 16 = 960<br>
