                while Athlete B covers 90 meters. In this case, Athlete A has defeated Athlete B by 10 meters.</li>
            <li>Beat by time: Suppose two athletes, A and B, are running a 100-meter race. Athlete A finishes the race
                in 12 seconds, while Athlete B finishes in 14 seconds. In this case, Athlete A has defeated Athlete B by

                <h3>In a kilometer race, A beats B by 10 meters. In a two-kilometer race, A beats B by how many meters?
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To understand this, let's break it down. In a 1-kilometer race, A beats B by 10 meters. This
                        means that for every 1 kilometer, A gains a lead of 10 meters over B.</li>
                    <li>Now, in a 2-kilometer race, A will maintain the same pace. So, for the first kilometer, A gains
                        10 meters on B, and for the second kilometer, A again gains 10 meters. Therefore, in total, A
                        beats B by 20 meters in a 2-kilometer race.</li>
                    <li>This logic extends to longer races as well. For every additional kilometer, A gains another 10
                        meters on B. Hence, in a 3-kilometer race, A would beat B by 30 meters.</li>
                    <li>So, the answer is that in a two-kilometer race, A beats B by 20 meters.</li>

                <h3>In a 1500 meter race, Anil beats Bakul by 150 meters, and in the same race, Bakul beats Charles by
                    75 meters. By what distance does Anil beat Charles?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>This problem might seem straightforward, but it requires careful calculation. Anil beats Bakul
                        by 150 meters, and Bakul beats Charles by 75 meters. Therefore, adding 150 + 75 won't give the
                        correct answer. Instead, we need to create separate 1500 meter races for Bakul and Charles and
                        analyze the ratios.</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>
                   Anil    Bakul   Charles
                   1500    1350    
                            1500   1425
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>We find the ratio by making Bakul's distance common. Anil beats Bakul by 150 meters, so Bakul
                        runs 1350 meters when Anil completes 1500 meters. Bakul beats Charles by 75 meters, so Charles
                        runs 1425 meters when Bakul completes 1500 meters.</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>
                   Anil    Bakul   Charles
                   1500    1350    1350
                   1500    1500    1425
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>Now, we calculate the ratio and find the equivalent distance for Anil and Charles:
                        <ul>
                            <li>1500 * 1500 : 1350 * 1425</li>
                            <li>200 : 171</li>
                            <li>Now, if 200 units represent 1500 meters,</li>
                            <li>1 unit = 1500 / 200 = 7.5 meters</li>
                            <li>Anil is ahead of Charles by 200 - 171 = 29 units</li>
                            <li>In meters, this distance is 29 * 7.5 = 217.5 meters</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Therefore, Anil beats Charles by 217.5 meters.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Let's analyze the race distances to understand the problem. A beats B by 20 meters, meaning when
                        A runs 100 meters, B runs 80 meters. Similarly, B beats C by 20 meters, so when B runs 100
                        meters, C runs 80 meters.</li>

                            <li>Now, if 25 units represent 100 meters,</li>
                            <li>1 unit = 100 / 25 = 4 meters</li>
                            <li>A beats C by 25 - 16 = 9 units</li>
                            <li>In meters, this distance is 9 * 4 = 36 meters</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                            <li>1 unit = 200 / 2000 = 0.1 meters</li>
                            <li>A beats C by 2000 - 1881 = 119 units</li>
