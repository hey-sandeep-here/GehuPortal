            <h2>Test of Divisibility</h2>
            <p>If a number is given and we want to know which number can divide it, there are some rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2: All even numbers are divisible by 2.</li>
                <li>3: If the sum of digits is divisible by 3, then that number will be divisible by 3. For example, in
                    4331, 4+3+3+1 = 11, which is not divisible by 3, so 4331 is not divisible by 3. On the other hand,
                    for 4332, 4+3+3+2 = 12, which is divisible by 3, so 4332 is also divisible by 3.</li>
                <li>4: Check the last 2 digits. If the last 2 digits are divisible by 4, then the whole number will be
                    divisible by 4. For example, in 136, 36 is divisible by 4, so 136 is also divisible by 4.</li>
                <li>5: Ends in 0 or 5.</li>
                <li>6: If a number is divisible by both 2 and 3, then it will be divisible by 6 as well.</li>
                <li>7: Double the last digit and subtract it from the remaining digits. If the result is divisible by 7,
                    then the whole number is divisible by 7. For example, in 427, double the last digit 7 (7 * 2 = 14)
                    and subtract it from the remaining digits 42 (42 - 14 = 28), which is divisible by 7, so 427 is
                    divisible by 7.</li>
                <li>8: Check the last 3 digits. If the last 3 digits are divisible by 8, then the whole number will be
                    divisible by 8. For example, in 1064, 064 is divisible by 8, so 1064 is also divisible by 8.</li>
                <li>9: The sum of digits should be a multiple of 9. For example, in 5283, 5+2+8+3 = 18, which is
                    divisible by 9, so 5283 is also divisible by 9.</li>
                <li>11: If the sum of the odd digits minus the sum of the even digits is a multiple of 11 or 0, then the
                    number is divisible by 11. For example, in 121, 1+1 - 2 = 0, hence it is divisible by 11.</li>
                <li>12: If a number is divisible by both 3 and 4, then it will be divisible by 12.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>LCM and HCF</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>LCM: The LCM of two or more numbers is the smallest multiple that is divisible by each of
                    the numbers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the smallest common multiple
                    of the given numbers.
                    <br>
                    For example, the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12 because 12 is the smallest multiple that both 4 and 6 share
                    without leaving any remainder when divided by either of them.
                </li>
                <li>The HCF or GCD of two or more numbers is the largest positive integer that divides each of
                    the numbers without leaving a remainder. In other words, it is the greatest common divisor
                    of the given numbers.
                    <br>
                    For example, the HCF of 12 and 18 is 6 because 6 is the largest number that both 12 and 18
                    can be divided evenly.

                <h3>Properties of HCF:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>HCF can't be bigger than the smaller number. For example, the HCF of 24 and 36 is 12, which
                        is smaller than both 24 and 36.</li>
                    <li>If there are no common factors between two numbers, then the HCF is 1. For instance, the HCF
                        of 9 and 28 is 1 because they have no common factors other than 1.</li>
                    <li>If a and xa are two numbers, where x is a non-zero integer, then the HCF will be a. For
                        example, the HCF of 4 and 12 is 4, and the HCF of 15 and 45 is 15.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Properties of LCM</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>LCM can't be smaller than either of the numbers. For instance, the LCM of 8 and 12 is 24,
                        which is greater than both 8 and 12.</li>
                    <li>If there are no common factors between two numbers, then the LCM is the product of the
                        numbers. For example, the LCM of 7 and 9 is 7 × 9 = 63 because they have no common factors.
                    </li>
                    <li>If a and xa are two numbers, where x is a non-zero integer, then the LCM is xa. For example,
                        the LCM of 3 and 15 is 15, and the LCM of 8 and 24 is 24.</li>

            <p>If the question asks to find the largest 3-digit number, then K will be the number that, when multiplied, gives the largest 3-digit number. For example, if the LCM is 60, the largest 3-digit number will be 60K, where K is the largest integer that makes the product a 3-digit number. In this case, K would be 16 because 60 × 16 = 960, which is the largest 3-digit number that is a multiple of 60.</p>
