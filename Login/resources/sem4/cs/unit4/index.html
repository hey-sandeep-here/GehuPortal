            <li>What is the meaning of interest?
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppose you are in need of some money and you went to your friend for help. He gave you 100
                        rupees and said to give it back in 1 year, but when you return it, you need to give an
                        additional 10 rupees (total 110). This extra money that you have to pay is known as interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>The extra money paid is interest.</li>
                    <li>The money we borrowed, 100 rupees, is the principal.</li>
                    <li>The duration after which we have to give it back is known as time, here 1 year.</li>
                    <li>The interest in this case is 10 rupees.</li>
                    <li>The total money we return, 110 rupees, is known as the amount.
                        <br>Formula of amount: principal + interest.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rate of interest is the interest we pay in one year upon the principal amount multiplied by 100.
                        <br>Rate = (Interest of 1 year / Principal) * 100
                        <br>Rate = (10 / 100) * 100 = 10%
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>There are two types of interest:
                <ol>
                    <li>Simple Interest: It is calculated only on the principal amount every year.</li>
                    <li>Compound Interest: It is calculated on the principal amount as well as on the interest received
                        every year.</li>

                        <br>Here, 1 represents the interest and 6 represents the principal, so the amount (principal +

                        <br>Amount ratio^3 = 7^3 = 343
                        <br>This is all in ratio.
                        <br>This means 216 in ratio corresponds to 2160 rupees (given principal amount).
                        <br>So, 1 ratio unit = 2160 / 216 = 10 rupees.
                        <br>We can also find the interest using the ratio:
                        <br>Interest ratio = Amount ratio - Principal ratio = 343 - 216 = 127
                        <br>Therefore, Compound Interest (CI) = 127 * 10 (value of one ratio unit)

                        <br>For 2 years, 11^2 = 121 (amount ratio units) and 10^2 = 100 (principal ratio units).

                        <br>Interest ratio for 2 years = 121 - 100 = 21
                        <br>CI for 2 years = 21 * 20 = 420

                        <br>Interest ratio for 3 years = 1331 - 1000 = 331
                        <br>CI for 3 years = 331 * 20 = 662
                        <br>We need CI for 2 years and 1/5 of the 3rd year:

                        <br>For the 2nd year, the amount becomes 2200, so CI will be 10% of 2200 = 220
                        <br>For the 3rd year, the amount is 2420, so CI will be 10% of 2420 = 242
                        <br>CI for 2 years = 200 + 220 = 420
                        <br>1/5 of the 3rd year's CI = 1/5 * 242 = 48.4

                        The rate 14(2/7)% can be written as a fraction: 14(2/7)% = 1/7.
                        <br>This means that the amount ratio after 1 year is 8 (principal + interest).
                        <br>For 3 years, the amount ratio is 8^3 = 512.
                        <br>If 512 ratio units equal 5120 in actual currency,
                        <br>then 1 ratio unit = 5120 / 512 = 10.
                        <br>Now, the principal ratio for 3 years is 7^3 = 343.
                        <br>Therefore, the principal amount = 343 * 10 (one ratio unit value) = 3430.

                    <li>Now, if T = 3 years and R = 10%, we first calculate the effective rate for the first two years,
                        and then use that result with the rate for the last year:
