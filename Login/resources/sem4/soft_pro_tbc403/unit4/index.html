                <li>Organizational planning is divided into four main phases: strategic, tactical, operational, and

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Strategic planning involves setting long-term goals and defining the overall direction
                                for the company.</li>
                            <li>These goals align with the company's mission, vision, and values.</li>
                            <li>This phase typically involves top managers and sometimes includes input from employees.
                            </li>
                            <li>Example: XYZ Company aims to become the top provider in its industry within the next
                                five years by expanding its product range and enhancing customer service.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Tactical Planning:</strong>
                        <ul>

                                strategic goals.</li>
                            <li>These plans usually span a year or less and are carried out by middle management.</li>
                            <li>Example: To support its strategic goal, XYZ Company plans a six-month marketing campaign
                                to increase brand recognition and attract new customers.</li>

                            <li>Specific tasks are assigned and protocols for tracking progress are established.</li>
                            <li>Example: XYZ Company’s operational team develops a detailed plan for the marketing
                                staff, outlining daily tasks and deadlines to ensure the campaign runs smoothly.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><strong>Contingency Planning:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Contingency planning involves preparing backup plans for unexpected events that could
                                disrupt the original plans.</li>
                            <li>This includes identifying potential risks and developing responses for those risks.</li>
                            <li>Possible scenarios include natural disasters, technology failures, or key personnel
