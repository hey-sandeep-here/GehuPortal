                <h3>Data Science Subject Areas</h3>
                <p>Broadly speaking, data science comprises of the three main subject areas:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Computer Science and Programming:</strong> Computational science and programming refer
                        to the study of computational tools like programming languages, software libraries, and other
                        tools. The knowledge of programming is essential for anyone who wishes to apply data science to
                        problems in their field.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Statistics and Machine Learning:</strong> Statistics and machine learning form the
                        theoretical foundations of data science methods and algorithms. An understanding of the
                        theoretical underpinnings of data science is required to know the limits of the methods being
                        applied, as well as to interpret the results of the data science process properly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Domain Knowledge:</strong> Domain knowledge is often referred to as a general discipline
                        or field to which data science is applied to. An expert or specialist in a field such as biotech
                        is said to possess domain knowledge of that industry.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>The first two items in the list above are essential skills that are required by all practitioners of
                    data science and are common to all applications of data science regardless of the domain.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, domain knowledge is more specialized. The lack of domain knowledge makes it
                    difficult to apply the right methods as well as to judge their performance properly. In fact, the
                    application of domain knowledge must be pervasive throughout the data science process in order for
                    it to be effective.</p>

                <h3>Data Science Process and Domain Knowledge</h3>
                <p>Here, we will discuss how domain knowledge applies to every part of the data science process. The
                    data science process can be divided into four sub-processes as described below. The following figure
                    summarizes the data science process:</p>
                <img src="../../images/py3.svg" alt="" class="wb">

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Problem Definition:</strong> The first step in any data science project is defining the
                        problem to be solved. It involves starting from a generic description of the problem and
                        defining desired performance criteria. For example, in financial data analysis, problem
                        definition could be predicting credit defaults based on past borrower data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:</strong> Most data collected in any field is
                        seldom clean and ready for use. Data cleaning and feature engineering involve transforming the
                        data and selecting relevant features. For instance, in healthcare data analysis, domain
                        knowledge helps in identifying important health indicators as features for predictive modeling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Model Building:</strong> The model-building step involves fitting a model to data to
                        solve the defined problem. The choice of an appropriate model is crucial and is influenced by
                        domain knowledge. For example, in marketing analytics, domain experts may use regression models
                        to predict customer purchasing behavior.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Performance Measurement:</strong> Performance measurement is the final step that
                        involves evaluating how well the model performs on new data. Domain knowledge is essential in
                        choosing performance metrics and thresholds that align with the specific goals and requirements
                        of the domain. For instance, in fraud detection, domain experts may focus on minimizing false
                        negatives to catch potential fraudsters.

                <h3>Case Study: Predicting Credit Card Delinquency</h3>
                <p>In this example, we'll explore how data science can help predict whether a customer will be late in
                    paying their credit card bill. This is important for credit card companies to manage risk and make
                    smart decisions about issuing credit cards.</p>
                <p>The data we have includes information about 100,000 customers and 10 different factors, such as their
                    payment history and credit score. One of the factors tells us if a customer has been late in paying
                    their bill in the past.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Step 1: Defining the Problem</strong>
                        <p>Our first task is to define the problem clearly. In this case, it's simply predicting if a
                            customer
                            will be late in paying their credit card bill.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 2: Cleaning and Organizing the Data</strong>
                        <p>We need to clean up the data because it's not evenly balanced between customers who are late
                            payers
                            and those who are on time. Most customers are on time with their payments, so we need to
                            adjust
                            for
                            this imbalance in our analysis.</p>
                        <p>A credit expert would know how to handle this imbalance, maybe by using a smaller but more
                            balanced
                            dataset for analysis.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 3: Building the Prediction Model</strong>
                        <p>Next, we build a model to predict late payments. Based on past research, a common approach is
                            to
                            use
                            logistic regression for this type of prediction.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Step 4: Evaluating Model Performance</strong>
                        <p>We evaluate the model's performance to see how well it predicts late payments. It's tricky
                            because a
                            simple accuracy measure might not show the full picture. We need to consider the cost of
                            misclassifying late payers and non-late payers.</p>
                        <p>For example, mistakenly flagging a good payer as late is less costly than missing a late
                            payer. A
                            credit expert would help us choose the right evaluation criteria based on these
                            considerations.

            <h2>Understanding Data Types in Data Science</h2>
            <p>Within the scope of Data Science, understanding different data types is fundamental to unlocking insights
                and making informed decisions. Data can be broadly categorized into structured, unstructured, and
                semi-structured formats, each presenting unique challenges and opportunities for analysis. Structured
                data is organized in a predefined format, like rows and columns in a database, making it easily
                searchable and analyzable. On the other hand, unstructured data lacks a predefined format, such as text
                documents or multimedia files, requiring advanced techniques for extraction and interpretation.
                Semi-structured data falls between these two, containing some organizational elements like tags or
                metadata but not conforming to a strict schema. Let's delve deeper into these data types to grasp their
                significance in the context of Data Science.</p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Structured Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The data, which is to the point, factual, and highly organized, is referred to as structured
                        data.</li>
                    <li>It is quantitative in nature, containing measurable numerical values like numbers, dates, and
                        times.</li>
                    <li>Structured data is easy to search and analyze.</li>
                    <li>It exists in a predefined format, often in relational databases consisting of tables with rows
                        and columns.</li>
                    <li>Examples of structured data include data in Excel files and Google Docs spreadsheets.</li>
                    <li>The programming language SQL (Structured Query Language) is used for managing structured data,
                        developed by IBM in the 1970s primarily for relational databases and warehouses.</li>
                    <li>Structured data is highly organized and understandable for machine language.</li>
                    <li>Common applications of structured data include sales transactions, airline reservation systems,
                        inventory control, and others.</li>

                <h3>Unstructured Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>All unstructured data includes files like log files, audio files, and image files.</li>
                    <li>Organizations often have a lot of unstructured data but struggle to derive value from it as it
                        is raw and lacks a predefined model or format.</li>
                    <li>Unstructured data requires significant storage space and is challenging to maintain security.
                    </li>
                    <li>It cannot be presented in a data model or schema, making it difficult to manage, analyze, or
                        search.</li>
                    <li>Unstructured data resides in various formats like text, images, audio, and video files.</li>
                    <li>It is qualitative in nature and is sometimes stored in non-relational databases or NoSQL
                        databases.</li>
                    <li>Unstructured data is not stored in relational databases, making it challenging for computers and
                        humans to interpret.</li>
                    <li>Managing unstructured data requires data science experts and specialized tools due to its
                        complexity.</li>
                    <li>The amount of unstructured data is much larger than structured or semi-structured data.</li>
                    <li>Examples of human-generated unstructured data include text files, emails, social media content,
                        and mobile data.</li>
                    <li>Machine-generated unstructured data includes satellite images, scientific data, sensor data, and
                        digital surveillance.</li>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Semi-structured Data</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Semi-structured data is information that does not reside in a relational database but has some
                        organizational properties, making it easier to analyze.</li>
                    <li>While some semi-structured data can be stored in relational databases with certain processes, it
                        can be challenging for certain types of semi-structured data.</li>
                    <li>Semi-structured data exists to save space and facilitate analysis.</li>
                    <li>An example of semi-structured data is XML data, which has a defined structure but does not fit
                        neatly into traditional relational database structures.</li>

            <h2>What Is Data Analysis?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Data analysis is the process of cleaning, changing, and processing raw data.</li>
                <li>It involves extracting actionable, relevant information that helps businesses make informed

                <li>Results are often presented in charts, images, tables, and graphs for better understanding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>A simple example of data analysis can be seen whenever we decide in our daily lives by evaluating what
                has happened in the past or what will happen if we make that decision. This is the process of analyzing
                the past or future and deciding based on that analysis.</p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>What Is the Data Analysis Process?</h3>
                <p>The process of data analysis, or alternately, data analysis steps, involves gathering all the
                    information, processing it, exploring the data, and using it to find patterns and other insights.
                </p>
                <p>Data Analysis is a process of collecting, transforming, cleaning, and modeling data to discover the
                    required information. The results so obtained are communicated, suggesting conclusions, and
                    supporting decision-making. Data visualization is at times used to portray the data for the ease of
                    discovering the useful patterns in the data. The terms Data Modelling and Data Analysis are the
                    same.</p>
                <p>Data Analysis Process consists of the following phases that are iterative in nature:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Requirements Specification</strong>: The data required for analysis is based on a
                        question or an experiment. For example, if a company wants to analyze customer satisfaction, the
                        data requirements might include customer ratings and feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: Gathering information on targeted variables ensuring accuracy
                        and honesty. In our example, data collection involves collecting customer ratings and feedback
                        from surveys and online platforms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Processing</strong>: Organizing collected data for analysis, which may involve
                        structuring it in rows and columns or creating data models. For instance, organizing customer
                        ratings and feedback into a spreadsheet or database format.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Cleaning</strong>: Preventing and correcting errors in processed data, such as
                        incomplete or duplicate entries. This step ensures that the data is accurate and reliable for
                        analysis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Analysis</strong>: Applying various techniques to understand and interpret data,
                        including statistical models like correlation and regression analysis. In our example, using
                        regression analysis to identify factors influencing customer satisfaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication/Visualization</strong>: Reporting analysis results in user-friendly
                        formats using data visualization techniques like charts and tables to convey insights clearly.
                        For example, creating a dashboard with charts showing customer satisfaction trends over time.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>After completing the data analysis process, the company can use the insights gained to make informed
                    decisions and take actions to improve customer satisfaction. The data-driven approach helps identify
                    areas of improvement and track progress over time, leading to better business outcomes.</p>

            <h2>Challenges of Conventional Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is a Conventional System?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A conventional system refers to traditional methods and technologies used for data storage,
                    processing, and analysis. These systems are often based on structured data formats and may rely on
                    relational databases or flat file storage. They are not designed to handle the volume, velocity, and
                    variety of data seen in big data environments.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Challenges with Big Data:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Volume: Conventional systems struggle to manage the massive volume of data generated daily.
                            Storing and processing terabytes or petabytes of data becomes impractical and
                            resource-intensive.</li>
                        <li>Velocity: The speed at which data is generated and needs to be processed is beyond the
                            capabilities of conventional systems. Real-time or near-real-time analysis is difficult to
                            achieve.</li>
                        <li>Variety: Big data encompasses structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data from
                            diverse sources like social media, IoT devices, sensors, and more. Conventional systems are
                            limited in handling this variety of data formats.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Challenges Due to Limited Scalability:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conventional systems often lack scalability to expand storage and computing resources
                            dynamically. This leads to performance bottlenecks and reduced efficiency as data volumes
                            grow.</li>
                        <li>Scalability challenges also impact the ability to process and analyze data in a timely
                            manner, hindering decision-making processes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Integration Issues:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integrating data from different sources into a unified format for analysis is complex and
                            time-consuming with conventional systems. Data silos and compatibility issues arise, making
                            it challenging to derive meaningful insights across datasets.</li>
