        <h1>Microcontroller</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A microcontroller is a combination of two words: 'micro' and 'controller'. 'Micro' means small in size,
                as we measure sizes in micro, nano, etc. Here, 'micro' refers to a measurement unit. 'Controller' means
                a device that controls the operation of any system. Combining these two words, we can say that a
                microcontroller is a small device that controls the operation of a particular system. We can also say
                that a microcontroller is a microprocessor in which all peripheral devices are integrated. That's why we
                call a microcontroller a 'system on chip' or 'computer on chip'. When all systems, peripherals, and
                components are integrated into a single chip, we call it a microcontroller.</li>
            <li>Microcontrollers are used in many applications, especially in embedded systems, to perform specific
                tasks. For example, they are used in washing machines or microwave ovens to control the operation of
                these devices. In a microwave oven, a microcontroller is used to control the temperature.
                Microcontrollers are used to perform such specific tasks.</li>
            <li>A microcontroller performs a specific type of task, and we choose its peripherals according to that
                task.</li>
            <li>A microcontroller includes a CPU, ROM, RAM, timer, counter, oscillator circuit, analog-to-digital
                converter, digital-to-analog converter, serial I/O ports, interrupt logic, and other functional blocks.
                All these components are integrated into a single chip. Therefore, we can say that a microcontroller is
                a complete system. However, we choose peripherals according to the application. For example, the task of
                a washing machine is to wash clothes. Therefore, we will select all the components required for this
                task in a microcontroller. The same applies to a microwave oven.</li>

            <h2>8051 Microcontroller: Introduction and History</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1981, Intel introduced an 8-bit microcontroller called the 8051. An 8-bit microcontroller means
                    it can process 8 bits of data at a time. <ul>
                        <li>The 8051 microcontroller was a revolutionary product at the
                            time of its release. Its introduction marked a significant milestone in the field of
                            embedded
                            systems, providing a compact and efficient solution for controlling electronic devices.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It was referred to as a system on a chip because it had a CPU, RAM, on-chip ROM, timers, counters,
                    and serial I/O ports all on a single chip.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The term "system on a chip" (SoC) is used because the
                            8051 integrates multiple components that are typically found in a computer system, all onto
                            a single
                            chip. This includes the central processing unit (CPU) for processing data, random-access
                            memory
                            (RAM) for temporary data storage, read-only memory (ROM) for permanent data storage, timers
                            and
                            counters for managing time-related operations, and serial input/output ports for
                            communication.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> NMOS (N-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology was initially
                    used to manufacture 8051 microcontrollers because it offered high-speed performance. However, NMOS
                    technology consumes more power, which is not ideal for battery-powered devices. To address this, the
                    industry shifted to using CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology, which is more
                    energy-efficient and extends the battery life of portable devices.
                </li>
                <li>It is widely used in embedded systems, consumer electronics, automotive systems, robotics, and
                    security cameras. <ul>
                        <li>The versatility and reliability of the 8051 microcontroller make it an ideal
                            choice for a wide range of applications. In embedded systems, it provides precise control
                            over
                            various electronic devices. In consumer electronics, it helps manage functions in devices
                            like
                            washing machines and microwave ovens. In automotive systems, it is used for engine control,
                            and in
                            robotics, it provides control over robotic movements. Security cameras use 8051
                            microcontrollers for
                            image processing and data handling.
                        </li>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>The peripherals are integrated into a single chip, making the overall system cost very low. By
                integrating all necessary components into a single chip, the 8051 microcontroller reduces the need
                for additional external components. This integration not only lowers the overall cost of the system
                but also simplifies the design and manufacturing process.
            </li>
            <li>The size of the product is small compared to microprocessor-based systems, making it very handy.

                <ul>
                    <li>Microcontroller-based systems, such as those using the 8051, are compact in size because they
                        consolidate multiple functions onto a single chip. This compactness makes the devices easier to
                        handle and integrate into various products.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Microcontroller-based systems are more reliable. Due to their integrated design,
                microcontroller-based systems have fewer points of failure compared to systems that rely on multiple
                separate components. This reliability makes them suitable for critical applications where consistent
                performance is essential.
            </li>
            <li>Microcontroller-based systems are easy to maintain. Since all the essential components are
                integrated onto a single chip, troubleshooting and repairing microcontroller-based systems is
                generally simpler and more straightforward than dealing with more complex systems that have many
                separate parts.
            </li>
            <li>All these features are available in a 40-pin IC. The 8051 microcontroller packs all of its powerful
                features into a small 40-pin integrated circuit (IC), making it a compact and efficient solution for
                various applications.

            <h2>Pin Diagram of 8051 Microcontroller</h2>
            <img src="../../images/microcontroller2.jpeg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>The 8051 microcontroller is available in a 40-pin Dual Inline Package (DIP). DIP refers to a type of
                    packaging for integrated circuits (ICs), where the IC is protected and can be easily handled,
                    assembled onto a Printed Circuit Board (PCB), and protected from damage. Various packaging types
                    include SIP (Single Inline Package), CDIP (Ceramic Dual Inline Package), ZIP (Zigzag Inline
                    Package), among others. Each package type has different configurations, which refer to the spacing
                    between pins and the rows of pins. These configurations are standardized to ensure compatibility and
                    protection of the IC.</li>
                <li>The 8051 microcontroller, being a DIP IC, has 40 pins. These pins are essential for connecting the
                    microcontroller to other components in a circuit.</li>
                <li>The 8051 microcontroller features four 8-bit bidirectional I/O ports named Port 0, Port 1, Port 2,
                    and Port 3. Each port consists of 8 pins, and they function as bidirectional I/O ports, meaning they
                    can operate as both input and output ports. Let’s discuss the function of each pin:</li>

            <p>The flag register, also known as the Program Status Word (PSW), is an 8-bit register used to indicate the
                status of the processor. The PSW contains flags that represent the result of arithmetic and logical
                operations. The 8051 microcontroller's flag register is divided into various flags, each serving a
                specific purpose. Let's discuss each flag with simple examples:</p>

            <h2>Interrupts in 8051</h2>
            <p>Interrupts play a vital role in microcontroller systems like the 8051, allowing the processor to respond
                to external events promptly. This lecture delves into the intricacies of interrupts in the 8051
                microcontroller, focusing on their types, vector addresses, priority management, and control mechanisms
                using the IE and IP registers.</p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Types of Interrupts in 8051:</h3>
                <p>Interrupts in the 8051 microcontroller help manage tasks efficiently.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hardware Interrupts:</strong> These interrupts are triggered by external hardware events
                        connected to the microcontroller.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: Imagine an 8051 microcontroller used in a security system. When a motion sensor
                            connected to the microcontroller detects movement, it sends a signal to trigger a hardware
                            interrupt. The microcontroller can then respond immediately to handle the security event,
                            such as sounding an alarm or capturing images.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Software Interrupts:</strong> These interrupts are initiated by software instructions
                        within the program running on the microcontroller.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: In an embedded system application, the software may need to perform periodic tasks
                            such as updating a display or processing user inputs. A software interrupt can be programmed
                            to occur at specific intervals to trigger these tasks. For instance, a software timer
                            interrupt can be set up to update a real-time clock display every second.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h3>Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) Execution:</h3>
                <img src="../../images/microcontroller5.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <p>When an interrupt occurs, the processor suspends the current program execution and jumps to the
                    corresponding ISR location. The ISR handles the interrupt-specific tasks and then returns to the
                    main program using the RETI (Return from Interrupt) instruction. The main program's address is
                    stored on the stack during ISR execution.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Interrupt Enable (IE) Register:
                </h3>
                <p>The IE register controls the enable/disable status of interrupts in the 8051 microcontroller. It
                    consists of several bit-addressable flags:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>EA (Enable All): Enables all interrupts when set to 1.</li>
                    <li>ES (Enable Serial): Enables the serial communication interrupt (RI/TI).</li>
                    <li>ET1 (Enable Timer 1), EX1 (Enable External Interrupt 1), EX0 (Enable External Interrupt 0):
                        Enable specific interrupts individually.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Enabling interrupts allows the processor to respond to external events based on their priority and
                    handling requirements.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Interrupt Priority (IP) Register</h3>
                <p>The IP register manages interrupt priorities in the 8051 microcontroller. It assigns higher priority
                    to certain interrupts based on bit settings:
                <ul>
                    <li>PX1 (Priority for External Interrupt 1), PT1 (Priority for Timer 1), PT0 (Priority for Timer 0),
                        PS (Priority for Serial): Setting these bits to 1 assigns higher priority to the corresponding
                        interrupts.</li>
                </ul>
                Adjusting interrupt priorities ensures critical tasks are handled promptly, enhancing system
                responsiveness and efficiency.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Controlling Interrupts:</h3>
                <p>By configuring the IE and IP registers, developers can control interrupt behavior in the 8051
                    microcontroller. Enabling specific interrupts and assigning priorities facilitate seamless event
                    handling, optimizing system performance in real-time applications.</p>
