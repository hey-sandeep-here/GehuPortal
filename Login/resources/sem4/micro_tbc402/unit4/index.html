        <h1>Assembly Language Programming (8085)</h1>
        <p>Assembly language programming for the 8085 microprocessor involves writing low-level code that directly
            controls the hardware. This type of programming is essential for understanding how microprocessors work,
            optimizing performance, and implementing critical real-time applications. The 8085 microprocessor, with its
            simple architecture and instruction set, is an excellent starting point for learning assembly language
            programming.</p>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Instruction Set</h2>
            <p>The instruction set of the 8085 microprocessor comprises various commands that dictate the processor's
                operations. These instructions are categorized into five main groups, each serving a distinct purpose:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Data Transfer Group</li>
                <li>Arithmetic Group</li>
                <li>Logical Group</li>
                <li>Branch Control Group</li>
                <li>Control Group</li>
            </ol>
            <ul>
                <li>To write Assembly Language Programs, we should be familiar with certain instructions. Here is a
                    review
                    of these instructions:</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Data Transfer Group</h3>
                <p>The Data Transfer Group includes instructions that handle the movement of data between registers,
                    memory, and I/O devices. These instructions are crucial for the effective manipulation of data
                    within the system.</p>

                <p>The addressing modes in this group specify how the operand is accessed. One of the most common modes
                    is the <strong>Immediate Mode</strong>, where the operand is included directly in the instruction,
                    enabling rapid execution without delay.</p>

                <p>Here are some key instructions under the immediate addressing mode:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>MVI B, 25H:</strong>
                        <br>The "MVI" instruction stands for "Move Immediate," indicating that the data (25H) is moved
                        directly into the specified register (B).
                        <br>Format: MVI [destination], [source]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> B &larr; 25H
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This instruction places the hexadecimal value 25 directly into
                        the B register. The "I" in "MVI" signifies that the operand is immediate, meaning it is provided
                        directly in the instruction itself.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>LXI B, 2000H:</strong>
                        <br>The "LXI" instruction stands for "Load Register Pair Immediate," indicating that the data
                        (2000H) is loaded directly into a specified register pair.
                        <br>Format: LXI [register pair], [data]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> B &larr; 20H, C &larr; 00H
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This instruction loads the immediate 16-bit data (2000H) into
                        the B-C register pair. Here, the higher byte (20H) is loaded into register B, and the lower byte
                        (00H) is loaded into register C. The "X" in "LXI" denotes that the instruction deals with a
                        register pair.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>MVI M, 25H:</strong>
                        <br>In this instruction, "M" stands for memory. The memory location is defined by the address
                        pointed to by the H-L register pair.
                        <br>Format: MVI M, [data]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> (HL) &larr; 25H
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This instruction loads the immediate value 25H into the memory
                        location pointed to by the H-L register pair. For instance, if the H-L pair is pointing to the
                        memory address C500, the value 25H will be stored at that specific memory location. The use of
                        "M" indicates that the data is being moved directly into the memory address defined by the
                        contents of the H-L register pair.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Now we have the <strong>Register Addressing Mode</strong>. In this mode, data is transferred through
                    registers. The following instructions fall under this category:</p>
                <ol start="4">
                    <li>
                        <strong>MOV B, C:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction moves the data from register C to register B.
                        <br>Format: MOV [destination], [source]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> B &larr; C
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The data in register C is transferred to register B. This
                        operation is useful when you need to copy data between registers without altering the original
                        data in the source register (C in this case).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>MOV B, M:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction moves the data from the memory location addressed by the H-L register pair
                        to register B.
                        <br>Format: MOV [destination], [source]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> B &larr; (HL)
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The data in the memory location pointed to by the H-L register
                        pair is transferred to register B. This instruction is useful for accessing data stored in
                        memory and moving it to a register for further processing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>MOV M, C:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction moves the data from register C to the memory location addressed by the H-L
                        register pair.
                        <br>Format: MOV [destination], [source]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> (HL) &larr; C
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The data in register C is transferred to the memory location
                        specified by the H-L register pair. This instruction is useful for storing data from a register
                        into a specific memory address for later use. For instance, if the H-L pair points to the memory
                        address 3000H, the data in register C will be moved to this address.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Now the following instructions come under the high-level instructions:</p>
                <ol start="7">
                    <li>
                        <strong>LDA 2000H:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction loads the accumulator with the data from the memory location 2000H.
                        <br>Format: LDA [address]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> A &larr; (2000H)
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The "LDA" instruction stands for "Load Accumulator." Although
                        the accumulator (A) is an 8-bit register, the address 2000H is 16-bit, indicating the location
                        in memory from which data is to be fetched. This instruction reads the data from the specified
                        memory address (2000H) and loads it into the accumulator for immediate use in subsequent
                        operations.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>STA 2000H:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction stores the contents of the accumulator into the memory location 2000H.
                        <br>Format: STA [address]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> (2000H) &larr; A
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The "STA" instruction stands for "Store Accumulator." It takes
                        the data in the accumulator and writes it to the specified memory address. For instance, if the
                        accumulator contains the value 5AH, executing STA 2000H will store this value at the memory
                        location 2000H.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>LDAX B:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction loads the accumulator with the contents of the memory location addressed by
                        the B-C register pair.
                        <br>Format: LDAX [register pair]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> A &larr; (BC)
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The "LDAX" instruction stands for "Load Accumulator Indirect."
                        It fetches data from the memory address specified by the B-C register pair and loads it into the
                        accumulator. If the B-C register pair points to address 3000H, executing LDAX B will load the
                        data from memory location 3000H into the accumulator.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>STAX B:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction stores the contents of the accumulator into the memory location addressed
                        by the B-C register pair.
                        <br>Format: STAX [register pair]
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> (BC) &larr; A
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The "STAX" instruction stands for "Store Accumulator
                        Indirect." It takes the data in the accumulator and writes it to the memory address specified by
                        the B-C register pair. If the accumulator contains the value 3FH and the B-C pair points to
                        address 4000H, executing STAX B will store 3FH at memory location 4000H.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Arithmetic Group</h3>
                <p>The Arithmetic Group includes instructions that perform various arithmetic operations such as
                    addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p>

                <p>We have the following instructions:</p>
                <ol start="11">
                    <li>
                        <strong>ADD B:</strong>
                        <br>In microprocessor instructions, the operand is fixed to register A, so it does not need to
                        be included in the instruction, resulting in a shorter instruction length.
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> A &larr; A + B
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This instruction adds the contents of register B to register
                        A, updating the value in register A with the sum.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>ADD M:</strong>
                        <br>Here, M represents a memory location where data is stored.
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> A &larr; A + [data at memory location M]
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This instruction adds the data stored at memory location M to
                        the contents of register A, updating the value in register A with the sum.
                        <br><strong>H and L Pair:</strong> In some microprocessor architectures like Intel 8085, the
                        `ADD M` instruction indirectly uses the H and L registers. The memory address specified by the
                        HL pair (H-L register pair) points to the memory location M. So, the data at the memory location
                        addressed by HL is added to register A.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>SUB B:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction subtracts the value in register B from the contents of register A.
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> A &larr; A - B
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The SUB B instruction performs subtraction by subtracting the
                        value in register B from the contents of register A, updating the result in register A.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>SUB M:</strong>
                        <br>Here, M represents a memory location where data is stored.
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> A &larr; A - [data at memory location M]
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This instruction subtracts the data stored at memory location
                        M from the contents of register A, updating the value in register A with the difference.
                        <br><strong>H and L Pair:</strong> Similar to the ADD M instruction, in architectures like Intel
                        8085, the `SUB M` instruction indirectly uses the H and L registers. The memory address
                        specified by the HL pair (H-L register pair) points to the memory location M, from which data is
                        subtracted from register A.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>INR B:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction increments the value in register B by 1.
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> B &larr; B + 1
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The INR B instruction increases the value in register B by 1,
                        updating the result in register B.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>DCR B:</strong>
                        <br>This instruction decrements the value in register B by 1.
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> B &larr; B - 1
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The DCR B instruction decreases the value in register B by 1,
                        updating the result in register B.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>INR M:</strong>
                        <br>Here, M represents a memory location where data is stored.
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> [data at memory location M] &larr; [data at memory location M] +
                        1
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This instruction increments the data stored at memory location

                        <br><strong>H and L Pair:</strong> In architectures like Intel 8085, the `INR M` instruction
                        indirectly uses the H and L registers. The memory address specified by the HL pair (H-L register
                        pair) points to the memory location M, where data is incremented by 1.

                        <strong>DCR M:</strong>
                        <br>Here, M represents a memory location where data is stored.
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> [data at memory location M] &larr; [data at memory location M] -
                        1
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This instruction decrements the data stored at memory location
                        M by 1, updating the value at that memory location.
                        <br><strong>H and L Pair:</strong> Similar to `INR M`, the `DCR M` instruction in certain
                        architectures indirectly uses the H and L registers to access and modify data at memory location
                        M.

                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> BC &larr; BC + 1
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The INX B instruction increases the BC register pair by 1,
                        updating the result in the BC register pair.

                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> The DCX B instruction decreases the BC register pair by 1,
                        updating the result in the BC register pair.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CMP B (Compare with Register B):</strong>
                        <br>In microprocessor instructions, the CMP B instruction compares the contents of the
                        accumulator
                        with the contents of register B.
                        <br><strong>Operation:</strong> A - B
                        <br><strong>Explanation:</strong> This instruction subtracts the contents of register B from the
                        contents of the accumulator, but the result is not stored. Instead, the flags are updated based
                        on
                        the result of the subtraction.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the accumulator is greater than the contents of register B, the carry flag (CY) is

                                and the zero flag (Z) is reset (Z = 0).</li>
                            <li>If the accumulator is equal to the contents of register B, the zero flag (Z) is set (Z =

                    flow constructs such as loops, conditionals, and function calls. The primary function of branch
