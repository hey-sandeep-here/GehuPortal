        <h1>Time series</h1>
        <p>A time series is a sequence of data points recorded at regular time intervals, used to track changes over
            time.</p>
        <p>A time series refers to a sequential collection of data points or observations recorded over time intervals.
            These intervals could be regular (daily, weekly, monthly) or irregular, depending on the nature of the data
            being observed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Time series data is of particular interest in economics, business, and commerce, where the values of a
                variable are observed chronologically by days, weeks, months, quarters, or years. This type of data
                provides insights into trends, patterns, and relationships over time, which are crucial for
                decision-making and analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Time series analysis is conducted primarily for two main purposes:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>To make forecasts for the future based on historical data trends. This forecasting helps businesses
                    and economists anticipate market trends, sales patterns, economic indicators, and other variables
                    crucial for planning and strategy.</li>
                <li>To evaluate past performance and understand the dynamics of the data over time. This includes
                    identifying seasonality, trends, cycles, and irregular fluctuations that can impact decision-making
                    and strategy formulation.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Applications of time series analysis are widespread:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Economists use time series analysis to estimate figures such as national income, inflation rates,
                    unemployment rates, and other key economic indicators. This information is vital for economic
                    policy-making, forecasting, and understanding economic trends.</li>
                <li>Businesses utilize time series analysis for sales forecasting, demand planning, inventory
                    management, financial modeling, and risk management. It helps businesses optimize operations,
                    allocate resources efficiently, and make informed decisions.</li>
                <li>In natural sciences, time series analysis is used in environmental monitoring, climate modeling,
                    geological studies, and more. It aids in understanding natural phenomena, detecting trends, and
                    predicting future events.</li>
                <li>Social scientists apply time series analysis in areas such as demographic studies, population
                    dynamics, crime rates analysis, and public policy evaluation. It provides insights into societal
                    trends, behavior patterns, and policy effectiveness.</li>

            <h2>Components of time series</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>&star; Secular trend or trend</li>
                <li>&star; Seasonal variations</li>
                <li>Cyclic variations</li>
                <li>Irregular Variations</li>
            </ol>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Secular Trend</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A secular trend is a long-term pattern or trend in data that shows consistent movement in a
                        single direction over an extended period.</li>
                    <li>Example:- The gradual increase in average global temperatures over the past century is a secular
                        trend.
                        This long-term trend shows a consistent upward movement in temperature data due to climate
                        change.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Seasonal Variations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seasonal variation refers to predictable changes in data that happen at the same time each year.
                        These changes follow a regular pattern due to seasonal factors such as weather, holidays, or
                        cultural events.</li>
                    <li>Example: Electricity use usually increases every summer because people use more air
                        conditioning.
                        This predictable increase in electricity use during the summer months is an example of
                        seasonal variation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Cyclic Fluctuations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cyclic fluctuation or variation refers to repetitive patterns of ups and downs in data over a
                        period of time. Unlike seasonal variation, which occurs at specific times each year, cyclic
                        variation follows a longer-term cycle that repeats at intervals longer than a year.</li>
                    <li>Example: The real estate market often experiences cycles of booms and busts, with periods of
                        rising property prices followed by downturns. This cyclic pattern of price fluctuations, which
                        may last several years, is an example of cyclic variation in the real estate industry.
                    </li>

            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Irregular Variations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Irregular variation refers to unpredictable or random fluctuations in data that do not follow a
                        specific pattern or cycle. These fluctuations can occur due to various unpredictable factors,
                        such as sudden changes in consumer behavior, unexpected events, or random occurrences.</li>
                    <li>Example: A company's daily sales may experience irregular variation when there is a sudden surge
                        in demand due to a viral social media post about their product. This spike in sales is not part
                        of a regular pattern and is considered an irregular variation in the data.</li>

                <h3>Semi Averages Method</h3>
                <p>Steps followed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Divide the Data:
                        Split your time series data into two equal halves. If you have an odd number of data points,
                        exclude the middle one for this method.</li>
                    <li>Calculate Averages: Compute the average (arithmetic mean) of the values in each half of the data
                        set. These become your "semi-averages."</li>
                    <li>Plot the Points: Assign the first semi-average to a point midway through the first half of the
                        data,
                        and the second semi-average to a point midway through the second half. Plot these two points on
                        a graph with time on the x-axis and the variable of interest on the y-axis.</li>
                    <li>Draw the Trend Line: Connect the two plotted points (representing the semi-averages) with a
                        straight line.
                        This line is considered your estimated trend line.</li>

                    Solution: Here we have even number of years so, these can be divided into two equal parts.

                <h3>Moving Average Method</h3>
                <p>This method is a more robust approach compared to semi-averages. It smooths out short-term
                    fluctuations in the data to reveal the underlying long-term trend (secular trend).</p>
                <p>Steps followed:
                <ol>
                    <li>Given Moving Average Size: You'll be provided with a specific number of data points to be
                        included in the moving average calculation (the moving average size).
                        This size determines how much smoothing is applied. A larger moving average size results in a
                        smoother line but might be less responsive to recent changes.</li>
                    <li>Calculate Moving Averages:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Odd Moving Average Size: Slide the window (encompassing the moving average size) across
                                your data set one position at a time.
                                For each window position, calculate the average of the data points within that window.
                                You'll directly get a moving average for each data point (except potentially the first
                                few and last few points depending on the moving average size).</li>
                            <li>Even Size (Centered Moving Average):
                                Here's the trick!
                                Because you have an even number of data points in the window, we need a special average
                                for the center. Slide the window as usual. For even-numbered window sizes, find the
                                center data point. To get its centered moving average, average the data point before it
                                and the one after it (basically, the sum of two neighbors divided by 2). Do this for all
                                center points in windows with even sizes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Plotting the Moving Averages:
                        The original data points are plotted on a graph with time on the x-axis and the variable of
                        interest on the y-axis. Subsequently, the calculated moving averages, including the centered
                        values for even moving average sizes, are plotted alongside the original data points.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Question 1:</strong> Find the 5 yearly moving average for the following:</p>

                <h3>Least Square Method</h3>
                <p>We will understand the least square method using the following question:
                    <br><strong>Q-</strong> Fit a straight line trend by the method of least squares (taking 1978 as the
                    year
                    of origin) for the following data:
                    <br><img src="../../images/lstsqimg1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>Step 1:
                        <br> The straight-line trend equation is given by:
                        <br>y = a + bx ---- (1)
                        <br>Normal equations:
                        <br>&sum; y = Na + b&sum; x ---- (2)
                        <br>where N = number of years of data given.
                        <br>&sum; xy = a&sum; x + b&sum; x<sup>2</sup> ---- (3)
                        <br>In the least squares method, we try to find the values of 'a' and 'b' using the normal
                        equations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 2:
                        <br> Create a table with columns for x, y, xy, and x<sup>2</sup> (these are the values required
                        in the normal equations).
                        <br><img src="../../images/lstsqimg2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                        <br>If the origin year is given in the question, then we can calculate the value of 'x' as the
                        row year minus
                        the origin year. If the origin year is not given, we have to assume it. The condition for
                        assuming the origin year is as follows:
                        <br>If 'N' is odd, the middle year can be taken as the origin year. If 'N' is even, the average
                        of the mid two years is taken as the origin year.
                        For example, for the years 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 'N' is even, so the average of 1981 and 1982,
                        which is equal to 1981.5, will be taken as the origin year.
                        Accordingly, 'x' will be calculated.
                        <br>Now, calculate &sum; x, &sum; y, &sum; xy, and &sum; x<sup>2</sup> as we require them in the
                        normal equations to solve them.
                        <br>&sum; x = 21, &sum; y = 60, &sum; xy = 248, and &sum; x<sup>2</sup> = 91.
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 3:

                        <br>Equation 3 becomes: 248 = 21a + 91b
                        <br>After solving these equations, we get a = 2.40 and b = 2.17.

            <ul>
                <li>Seasonal variations are short-term fluctuations in recorded values due to different circumstances.
                    These variations are measured through their indices called seasonal indices.</li>
                <li>In seasonal variation analysis, we examine how data changes with seasons. For example, in summer or
                    winter, a business may see changes in profit. By understanding these variations, a business person
                    can plan for the future. All of this comes under seasonal variations.</li>
                <li>We will find the seasonal index, which measures the seasonal effect. The methods for finding the
                    seasonal index are:

                        <br>The trend equation is: y = 56 + 12x
                        <br>Trend values for each year:
                        <pre>
Year      Trend Value
-----------------------
1987        56 + 12(-2) = 32
1988        56 + 12(-1) = 44
1989        56 + 12(0)  = 56
1990        56 + 12(1)  = 68
1991        56 + 12(2)  = 80
        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li>Step 2:
                        <br>Calculating the quarterly trend:
                        <br>The yearly trend values are 32, 44, 56, 68, and 80, with a common difference of 12.
                        <br>The yearly increment is 12.
                        <br>The quarterly increment is 12 / 4 = 3.
                        <br>In the quarterly trend value table, the first year data is calculated as shown, and for
                        subsequent years, we add the yearly increment (12).

                    <li>Step 3:
                        <br>Calculating quarterly values as a percentage of the trend value:
                        <br>Percentage = (O / T) * 100 where O is the observed value and T is the quarterly trend value
                        calculated in step 2.

                    <li>Step 4:
                        <br>Calculating the seasonal indices:
                        <br>First, find the general average (GA): GA = sum of all quarterly averages / 4
                        <br>= (92.78 + 118.26 + 102.92 + 89.12) / 4
                        <br>= 403.08 / 4
                        <br>= 100.77
                        <br>Now, calculate the Seasonal Index = (Quarterly Average / General Average) * 100
                        <br>Seasonal index for 1st quarter = (92.78 / 100.77) * 100 = 92.1
                        <br>Seasonal index for 2nd quarter = (118.26 / 100.77) * 100 = 117.4
                        <br>Seasonal index for 3rd quarter = (102.92 / 100.77) * 100 = 102.1
                        <br>Seasonal index for 4th quarter = (89.12 / 100.77) * 100 = 88.4
