            <h2>Floating Point Arithmetic</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Floating point arithmetic is a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics, used for
                    representing and handling real numbers in binary form.</li>
                <li>It is essential for converting real values like 9.2 * 10<sup>-5</sup> into binary form, as many real
                    numbers cannot be precisely represented in the binary system due to its finite precision.</li>
                <li>Floating point arithmetic provides a way to approximate and handle real numbers with a wide range of
                    magnitudes, allowing computers to perform complex calculations involving decimal fractions and large
                    or small numbers efficiently.</li>
                <li>One of the key components of floating point arithmetic is the representation of numbers using a sign
                    bit, exponent, and mantissa, which allows for expressing numbers in scientific notation.</li>
                <li>However, it's important to note that floating point arithmetic can introduce rounding errors and
                    precision issues, especially when dealing with extremely small or large numbers or performing
                    extensive calculations.</li>
                <li>Modern computer systems typically implement standards like IEEE 754 to define the format and
                    operations for floating point arithmetic, ensuring consistency and accuracy across different
                    platforms.</li>

                <h3>Applications of Floating Point Arithmetic</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Representation of Real Numbers: Floating point arithmetic is used to represent real numbers in
                        computer systems, allowing for the handling of decimal fractions and large or small numbers.
                    </li>
                    <li>Standardization: Floating point arithmetic follows standardized formats and operations, such as
                        IEEE 754, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different computing platforms and
                        programming languages.</li>
                    <li>Efficiency and Speed: Floating point arithmetic enables efficient and speedy computation of
                        complex mathematical operations, making it essential for scientific computing, simulations, and
                        graphics processing.</li>
                    <li>Numerical Stability: It provides numerical stability by minimizing rounding errors and
                        maintaining accuracy in calculations, crucial for scientific and engineering applications where
                        precision is critical.</li>
                    <li>Handling a Large Range of Magnitude: Floating point arithmetic supports computations involving a
                        wide range of magnitudes, from very small numbers (e.g., subatomic particles) to extremely large
                        numbers (e.g., astronomical distances), facilitating versatile and accurate numerical
                        processing.</li>

                <h3>Significant Digits</h3>
                <p>In a real or decimal number, the digits used to express the number are called significant digits.
                    Here are the criteria for determining significant digits:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Digits from 1 to 9 are significant. For example, in 123, all three digits are significant.</li>
                    <li>Zero (0) is a significant digit in many cases, but there are specific times when it is not
                        significant:
                        <ul>
                            <li>When zero is used just to show the position of the decimal point. For example, in 0.001,
                                only the digit 1 is significant because the zeros are just placeholders.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Example: In 0.001, only the digit 1 is significant.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>When zero is used to fill in places in large numbers without adding precision. For
                                example, in 100, the zeros are not significant because they only indicate that the
                                number is in the hundreds.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        However, there are cases where zeros are significant:
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a zero appears between other significant digits, it is also significant.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Example: In 105, all digits (1, 0, 5) are significant.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>If a zero comes after a decimal point and after another significant digit, it is also
                                significant.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Example: In 2.50, all digits (2, 5, 0) are significant.</li>
                                    <li>Example: In 2.500000, all digits are significant.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Criteria for Significant Digits:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>All non-zero digits are significant. For example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 456, all three digits are significant.</li>
                            <li>In 0.00478, all digits except zeros after the decimal point are significant.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Zero digits are significant when:
                        <ul>
                            <li>They lie between significant digits. For example, in 102, both zeros are significant
                                because they are between 1 and 2.</li>
                            <li>They are to the right of the decimal point and to the right of a non-zero digit. In
                                10.20, both zeros are significant.</li>
                        </ul>

            <h2>Errors in Numerical Computation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Errors in numerical computation refer to disparities between the actual value of a quantity and
                    its approximate value obtained through measurement or calculation. These errors are inherent in the
                    process of representing real-world values with finite precision in numerical systems.</li>
                <li>There are several ways to describe errors in measurements and calculations. One common definition of
                    error is the difference between the actual value x and the approximate value x<sup>a</sup>.
                    Mathematically, the error E is calculated as: E = x - x<sup>a</sup></li>
                <li>
                    Errors occur due to the following two reasons:
                    <br>
                    I. Errors in the data: These errors stem from inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data itself,
                    such as measurement errors, data entry mistakes, or incomplete data.
                    <br>
                    II. Errors of calculation: These errors arise during the process of mathematical calculations or
                    computations, such as rounding errors, truncation errors, or algorithmic inaccuracies.
                    <br>
                    Error in the data is often inherent and challenging to rectify, as it depends on the quality and
                    reliability of the data sources. On the other hand, errors of calculation can usually be minimized
                    to a very small magnitude with careful attention to mathematical precision and techniques.
                    <br>
                    For example, the use of the mathematical constant Pi (π) can vary slightly in different contexts,
                    leading to potential errors. However, by using more accurate approximations of Pi, such as 3.1416
                    instead of 3.14, the error in calculations involving Pi can be reduced significantly.
                </li>
                <li>Various types of errors occur in numerical computation are as under:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Data Errors: These errors occur due to inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data itself,
                            such as missing values, incorrect measurements, or data entry mistakes. For example, if a
                            dataset contains a value of 9999 instead of 999, it introduces a significant data error.
                        </li>
                        <li>Truncation Errors: Truncation errors arise when a calculation or measurement is approximated
                            by discarding digits beyond a certain point. For instance, if a calculation involving Pi (π)
                            is truncated to 3.14 instead of using more decimal places like 3.14159, it introduces a
                            truncation error.</li>
                        <li>Round-off Errors: Round-off errors occur when a calculation involves rounding numbers to a
                            specified number of decimal places. For example, rounding 1.235 to two decimal places
                            results in 1.24, introducing a round-off error from the original value.</li>
                        <li>Absolute Errors: Absolute errors represent the magnitude of the difference between the
                            actual value and the measured or calculated value. For instance, if a measurement of 15.3 cm
                            is recorded as 15.5 cm, the absolute error is |15.5 - 15.3| = 0.2 cm.</li>
                        <li>Relative Errors: Relative errors express the error as a ratio or percentage of the actual
                            value. It is calculated as the absolute error divided by the actual value. For example, if
                            the actual length is 10 cm and the measured length is 9.5 cm, the relative error is (10 -
                            9.5) / 10 = 0.05 or 5%.</li>
                        <li>Percentage Errors: Percentage errors are a specific form of relative errors expressed as a
                            percentage of the actual value. Using the previous example, the percentage error would be 5%
                            if the actual length is 10 cm and the measured length is 9.5 cm.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Algebraic equations are mathematical expressions composed of variables and constants, combined using
                    addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. There are several types of algebraic
                    equations, including:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Linear equations - General form ax + b = 0; where a, b are constants and x is the
                            variable.</li>
                        <li>Quadratic equations - General form ax^2 + bx + c = 0; where a, b, c are constants and x is
                            the variable.</li>
                        <li>Polynomial equations - General form P(x) = a<sub>n</sub> x<sup>n</sup> +
                            a<sub>n-1</sub>x<sup>n-1</sup> + ... + a<sub>1</sub>x<sup>1</sup> +
                            a<sub>0</sub>x<sup>0</sup>; where a<sub>n</sub>,
                            a<sub>n-1</sub>, a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>0</sub> are constants and x is the variable.</li>
                        <li>Rational equations - The general form of a rational equation is P(x) / Q(x) = 0, where P(x)
                            and Q(x) are polynomials.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Transcendental equations are mathematical expressions that involve functions which cannot be
                    expressed algebraically. These functions may include exponential, logarithmic, or trigonometric
                    functions.</li>
                <li>Transcendental equations play a crucial role in modeling a wide range of real-world phenomena. Some
                    notable applications include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Radioactive decay</li>

                    These equations often defy direct algebraic solutions, necessitating the use of numerical or
                    iterative techniques for finding accurate solutions. The understanding and analysis of
                    transcendental equations are essential in addressing complex scenarios in fields such as physics,
                    engineering, and various scientific disciplines.

                <h3>What is the Root of an Equation?</h3>
                <p>The root of an equation is a value that, when substituted into the equation, makes the equation equal
                    to zero. In other words, it is a solution or solutions that satisfy the equation by reducing it to
                    zero.</p>

                <p>For example, consider the quadratic equation:</p>

                <strong>ax^2 + bx + c = 0</strong>

                <p>The roots of this equation can be found using the quadratic formula:</p>

                <pre>
x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
</pre>

                <p>In this formula, the values of <strong>a</strong>, <strong>b</strong>, and <strong>c</strong> are
                    coefficients of
                    the quadratic equation. The ± symbol indicates that there are usually two roots: one with the
                    positive square root and one with the negative square root.</p>

                <p>So, the roots of the quadratic equation are the values of <strong>x</strong> that, when substituted
                    into
                    the equation, make it equal to zero.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Bisection Method: This method is relatively slower because it involves narrowing down the
                        interval by halving it repeatedly until the root is found. It guarantees convergence but can be
                        slower compared to other methods.</li>
                    <li>Regula Falsi Method: Also known as the false position method, this approach is generally slower
                        than some other methods because it combines aspects of both bisection and secant methods, which
                        can lead to slower convergence.</li>
                    <li>Iterative Methods: These methods, such as fixed-point iteration or the method of successive
                        approximations, can be faster than bisection and regula falsi but may still require several
                        iterations to converge, especially for complex functions or poorly chosen initial guesses.</li>
                    <li>Secant Method: The secant method is faster than bisection and regula falsi because it uses
                        secant lines to approximate the root, leading to quicker convergence compared to linear methods
                        like bisection.</li>
                    <li>Newton-Raphson Method: This method is often the fastest among these options because it utilizes
                        both the function and its derivative to iteratively refine the root approximation. It converges
                        quadratically, which means it can converge much faster than linear methods like bisection and
                        even secant.</li>

                <h3>Secant method</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The secant method bears similarities to the regula falsi method, and it is known for its faster
                        convergence compared to the regula falsi method.</li>
                    <li>However, it's important to note that convergence is not guaranteed in the case of the secant
                        method. The secant method is also referred to as the chord method.</li>
                    <li>The generation of a new point in the secant method is determined using the formula: <br>
                        <span class="ms">\(x_{i+1} = x_{i-1} - \frac{x_{i} - x_{i-1}}{f(x_{i-1}) - f(x_{i})} *
                            f(x_{i-1})\)</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>As this method is not a root bracket method so we don't have to check that condition (f(xnext) *
                        f(xl)
                        &lt; 0).</li>

                <h3>Newton-Raphson Method</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Newton-Raphson method takes only a single guess to find the next root. It is the most
                        preferred method for finding the root of an equation and is also known as the method of
                        tangents. Selection of the initial guess ensures that this algorithm converges faster than other
                        algorithms. The next guess is found using the formula. <br>
                        <span class="ms">\(x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\)</span>
                        <br>For inital guess take the \(x_0\) which is closer to 0 out of initial bracket.
                        <br>We keep finding next term until the terms are repeated.
                    </li>
                    <li>Derivation or differentiation is a mathematical concept that measures how a quantity changes
                        when another related quantity undergoes a change. In simpler terms, it provides a way to
                        understand the rate at which one variable changes concerning another. For example, if we have a
                        function describing the position of an object over time, the derivative of that function with
                        respect to time gives us the object's velocity.</li>
