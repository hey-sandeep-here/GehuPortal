            <h2>Linear Programming Problem (LPP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is LPP?</strong>
                    Linear Programming Problem (LPP) is a mathematical technique used to achieve the best possible
                    outcome in a given situation, often involving maximization of profits or minimization of costs.
                    Think about running a business—what is the main goal? The primary objective is usually profit
                    maximization or cost minimization.
                    <br>
                    For example, a company might want to maximize its profit or minimize its costs given a set of
                    limitations or resources. In LPP, the objective function is the formula that represents this goal.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Objective Function:</strong>
                    In LPP, we typically encounter two types of problems:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Maximization: An objective function might look like <strong>Z = x + 2y</strong>, where the
                            goal is to maximize Z (profit, output, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Minimization: Another example could be <strong>Z = 2x + 3y</strong>, where the objective is
                            to minimize Z (cost, time, etc.).</li>
                    </ul>
                    The variables <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> are decision variables that represent
                    quantities (like products, resources, etc.) in the real-world problem.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Constraints:</strong>
                    Every business operates under certain limitations, such as limited resources like manpower, money,
                    time, land, or raw materials. These limitations are known as <strong>constraints</strong> in LPP.
                    <br>
                    Constraints are represented as inequalities because they indicate the limits within which the
                    decision variables must operate. For example:
                    <br><strong>2x + 3y ≥ 5</strong> (resource must be more than or equal to 5)<br>
                    <strong>x + y ≤ 7</strong> (resource must be less than or equal to 7)
                </li>

                <li><strong>Non-negativity Restriction:</strong>
                    In most real-world scenarios, the decision variables (like products, resources, etc.) cannot be
                    negative. Therefore, in LPP, we assume:
                    <br><strong>x ≥ 0</strong>, <strong>y ≥ 0</strong>
                    <br>
                    This condition ensures that the solution is realistic and practical.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Summary of LPP Components:</strong>
                    In summary, a Linear Programming Problem consists of two main components:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Objective Function</strong>: This is the function you aim to maximize or minimize
                            (profit, cost, time, etc.).</li>
                        <li><strong>Constraints</strong>: These are the limitations or restrictions on the resources
                            available, usually in the form of inequalities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Together, these components form the LPP model, which helps in decision-making for optimal outcomes.

                        <br><strong>Subject to the constraints:</strong>
                        <br><strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> ≤ 4</strong>
                        <br><strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> ≤ 6</strong>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Step 1: Find the coordinates</strong>
                            <br>We start by finding the points where the constraints intersect the axes, as these points
                            will help us plot the lines representing the constraints.
                            <br>

                            <br>To find the points where the line intersects the x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> axes:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If <strong>x<sub>2</sub> = 0</strong>, then <strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 4</strong>,
                                    giving the point
                                    (4, 0).</li>
                                <li>If <strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 0</strong>, then <strong>x<sub>2</sub> = 2</strong>,
                                    giving the point
                                    (0, 2).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <strong>For the constraint <strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> ≤ 6</strong>:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If <strong>x<sub>2</sub> = 0</strong>, then <strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 2</strong>,
                                    giving the point
                                    (2, 0).</li>
                                <li>If <strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 0</strong>, then <strong>x<sub>2</sub> = 3</strong>,
                                    giving the point
                                    (0, 3).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Step 2: Draw the lines and identify the feasible region</strong>
                            <br>We now plot the lines <strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4</strong> and
                            <strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 6</strong> on a graph using the points found
                            earlier.
                            <br>
                            The feasible region is the area where both constraints overlap, and it represents the
                            possible
                            values of <strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>x<sub>2</sub> </strong> that satisfy
                            all
                            constraints.
                            <br>
                            Since both constraints have ≤, the feasible region will be the area below both lines,
                            towards
                            the origin (0, 0).

                        <li><strong>Step 3: Identify the corner points of the feasible region</strong>
                            <br>The optimal solution of an LPP in the graphical method will always lie at one of the
                            corner
                            points (vertices) of the feasible region.
                            <br>The corner points in this example are:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>O</strong>: (0, 0) – the origin</li>
                                <li><strong>A</strong>: (2, 0) – where <strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> =
                                        6</strong>
                                    intersects the x<sub>1</sub>-axis</li>
                                <li><strong>C</strong>: (0, 2) – where <strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> =
                                        4</strong>
                                    intersects the x<sub>2</sub>-axis</li>
                                <li><strong>B</strong>: The intersection of the two constraints
                                    <strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4</strong> and
                                    <strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 6</strong>. To find B, we solve both
                                    equations
                                    simultaneously:
                                    <br>Solve the system:
                                    <br><strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4</strong>
                                    <br><strong>3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 6</strong>
                                    <br>Subtract the first equation from the second:
                                    <br><strong>(3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub>) - (x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub>) = 6
                                        - 4</strong>
                                    <br>This simplifies to:
                                    <br><strong>2x<sub>1</sub> = 2</strong>, so <strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 1</strong>.
                                    <br>Substitute <strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 1</strong> into
                                    <strong>x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4</strong>:
                                    <br><strong>1 + 2x<sub>2</sub> = 4</strong>, so <strong>x<sub>2</sub> =
                                        3/2</strong>.
                                    <br>The intersection point <strong>B</strong> is (1, 3/2).
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Step 4: Evaluate the objective function at each corner point</strong>
                            <br>Now, we substitute the coordinates of each corner point into the objective function
                            <strong>Z = 3x<sub>1</sub> + 4x<sub>2</sub></strong> to find the value of Z at each point:
                            <ul>
                                <li>At <strong>O</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(0) + 4(0) = 0</strong></li>
                                <li>At <strong>A</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(2) + 4(0) = 6</strong></li>
                                <li>At <strong>B</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(1) + 4(3/2) = 3 + 6 = 9</strong></li>
                                <li>At <strong>C</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(0) + 4(2) = 8</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Step 5: Determine the optimal solution</strong>
                            <br>Since the problem is a maximization problem, the optimal solution will be the point that
                            gives the maximum value of Z.
                            <br>From the calculations, we see that the maximum value of Z is 9, which occurs at point
                            <strong>B (1, 3/2)</strong>.
                            <br>Thus, the optimal solution is:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 1</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>x<sub>2</sub> = 3/2</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Step 6: Minimization (if required)</strong>
                            <br>If we were tasked with minimizing Z instead of maximizing it, the minimum value would
                            occur
                            at the origin <strong>O (0, 0)</strong>, where <strong>Z = 0</strong>.

                            The feasible region in this case will be above both lines (away from the origin), as the

                            The common area between the two constraints will give us the feasible region where both

                        <li><strong>Step 3: Identify the corner points of the feasible region</strong>
                            <br>Just like in the maximization case, the optimal solution for a minimization problem also
                            lies at one of the corner points (vertices) of the feasible region.

                                <li><strong>R</strong>: The intersection of the two constraints. To find this point, we
                                    solve both equations simultaneously:

                                    <br>Substitute <strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 1</strong> into

                            <br>Now we substitute the coordinates of each corner point into the objective function
                            <strong>Z = 3x<sub>1</sub> + 4x<sub>2</sub></strong> to find the value of Z at each point:
                            <ul>
                                <li>At <strong>P</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(4) + 4(0) = 12</strong></li>

                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Step 5: Determine the optimal solution</strong>
                            <br>Since the problem is a minimization problem, the optimal solution will be the point that
                            gives the minimum value of Z.
                            <br>From the calculations, we see that the minimum value of Z is 9, which occurs at point
                            <strong>R (1, 3/2)</strong>.
                            <br>Thus, the optimal solution is:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>x<sub>1</sub> = 1</strong></li>

                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Note: Unbounded Solution (if the question was for maximization)</strong>
                            <br>If this problem were a maximization problem, the solution would be unbounded.
                            <br>This is because, as we move away from the origin in the feasible region, the value of Z
                            increases indefinitely.
                            <br>Thus, there is no maximum value for Z, and we say the solution is unbounded.

                            <br>Since the objective function gives the same value of <strong>Z = 6</strong> at both points A
                            and B, we have an <strong>alternate optimal solution</strong>.
                            <br>This means that there are multiple optimal solutions that give the same maximum value of
                            Z, in this case, at both points A (2, 0) and B (1, 3/2).
                            <br>However, due to the nature of the constraints, every point on the line segment
                            connecting A and B also yields a value of <strong>Z = 6</strong>. Therefore, there are
                            infinitely many solutions within that segment, leading to an <strong>infinite
                                solution</strong> scenario.
                            <br>Thus, this problem can be classified as having both an <strong>alternate

                            <br>Now, we substitute the coordinates of each corner point into the objective function
                            <strong>Z = 3x<sub>1</sub> + 2x<sub>2</sub></strong> to find the value of Z at each point:

                                <li>At <strong>O</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(0) + 2(0) = 0</strong></li>
                                <li>At <strong>A</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(2) + 2(0) = 6</strong></li>
                                <li>At <strong>B</strong>: <strong>Z = 3(1) + 2(3/2) = 3 + 3 = 6</strong></li>

                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Step 5: Determine the optimal solution</strong>
                            <br>In this case, we have two points (A and B) that give the same maximum value of Z:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>A (2, 0):</strong> Z = 6</li>
                                <li><strong>B (1, 3/2):</strong> Z = 6</li>
                            </ul>
                            This indicates that there are multiple optimal solutions. Therefore, the solution is
                            classified as an <strong>alternative optimal solution</strong> since the maximum Z can be
                            achieved at both points.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Step 6: Discuss the type of solution</strong>
                            <br>Since both points A and B yield the same maximum value for Z (which is 6), we can
                            conclude that:
                            <ul>
                                <li>This problem has <strong>alternative solutions</strong>, as there are multiple
                                    combinations of <strong>x<sub>1</sub></strong> and <strong>x<sub>2</sub></strong>
                                    that
                                    maximize the objective function.</li>
                                <li>Moreover, if we extend the feasible region further, we may find that there are
                                    infinite solutions along the line segment connecting points A and B. Hence, the
                                    solution can also be described as having <strong>infinite optimal

                            now here Zj we get CB * x1 (row 1) + CB * x1 (row 2) and we do it for x2, x3, x4 
                            <br>as we want tor eplace x3 and x4 by x1 and x2 from Xb so we find the most negative value from Zj - Cj row and here the most negative value is -5 so as this is in the x1 column hence x1 becomes our entrying variable.
                            <br>Now either this enterying varabiel (x1) will replace x3 or x4 from Xb column so to find that we find the min ration of b and the column where the entrying variable is found so there the ratio wil be of b and x1

                            so as 10/5 < 15/3 & 10/5 is in row 2 and at b column x4 is located hence x4 is the outgoing variable

                    <ul>
                        <li>To solve an LPP using the Simplex Method, we must ensure that the objective function is in
                            maximization form. If it is a minimization problem, we first convert it to a maximization
                            problem.</li>
                        <li>If the given objective function is in the form of minimization (Min Z), we can convert it
                            into a maximization problem by using the following relationship:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Max Z' = -Min Z</li>
                                <li>For example, if the objective is to minimize Z = 5x<sub>1</sub> + 3x<sub>2</sub>, we
                                    convert
                                    it to:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Max Z' = - (5x<sub>1</sub> + 3x<sub>2</sub>)</li>
                                        <li>This simplifies to: Max Z' = -5x<sub>1</sub> - 3x<sub>2</sub></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Now, we can proceed to solve the maximization problem using the Simplex Method.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Next, we need to balance the constraints. For constraints with ≤ signs, we add slack
                            variables to convert inequalities into equalities. For example, if we have a ≤ constraint,
                            we add a slack variable. Similarly, if we have a ≥ constraint, we subtract a surplus
                            variable to achieve equality.</li>

                        <li>Now, converting the given problem:
                            <br>Maximize Z = 5x1 + 3x2 + 0x3 + 0x4 (introducing slack variables x3 and x4)

                            <br>3x1 + 5x2 + x3 = 15
                            <br>5x1 + 2x2 + x4 = 10
                            <br>All variables x1, x2, x3, x4 ≥ 0
                        </li>

                        <li>The variables x3 and x4 are known as the basic variables, as they form the identity matrix
                            in the system of equations. The basic variables usually include the slack variables we
                            introduced. The objective now is to make the decision variables (x1, x2) the basic variables
                            through iterations.</li>

                        <li>We now create the initial Simplex tableau as follows:

                                <li><strong>CB</strong> represents the cost of the basic variables in the objective
                                    function (initially zero for slack variables).</li>
                                <li><strong>Xb</strong> represents the basic variables.</li>
                                <li><strong>Cj</strong> represents the cost coefficients of the decision variables x1,
                                    x2, and slack variables x3, x4 in the objective function.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                        <li>Next, we perform the Simplex iteration. We want to bring x1 and x2 into the basis:
                            <pre>

      Zj  |     |  0   |  0   |  0   |  0   |
      Cj  |     |  5   |  3   |  0   |  0   |
 Zj - Cj  |     | -5   | -3   |  0   |  0   |
        </code>
    </pre>

                            <p>
                                To calculate <strong>Zj</strong>, we use the formula <strong>Zj = CB × B</strong>,
                                where:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>CB</strong> is the cost coefficient of the basic variables in the basis
                                    (here, x3 and x4).</li>
                                <li><strong>B</strong> is the column for the variable we are calculating
                                    <strong>Zj</strong> for.</li>
                            </ul>
                            For example, for the x1 column:
                            <br>
                            <strong>Zj(x1) = (CB(row1) × B(row1,x1)) + (CB(row2) × B(row2,x1))</strong><br>
                            Substituting the values:
                            <br>
                            <strong>Zj(x1) = (0 × 3) + (0 × 5) = 0</strong>
                            <br>
                            Similarly, <strong>Zj</strong> for x2, x3, and x4 will be calculated. In this iteration,
                            since all the current
                            basic variables (x3 and x4) have cost coefficients of 0, all Zj values will be 0.
                            </p>

                            <p>After calculating Zj, we compute <strong>Zj - Cj</strong>, which shows the difference
                                between the calculated and actual costs.
                                The most negative value, -5 (in the x1 column), indicates that x1 should enter the
                                basis.</p>

                            <p>To decide which variable to remove from the basis (x3 or x4), we compute the minimum
                                ratio of b values and the
                                coefficients in the x1 column:</p>
                            <pre>
        <code>
          | Cj  |   5  |   3  |   0  |   0  |
 CB | Xb  |  b  |  x1  |  x2  |  x3  |  x4  | min ratio
--------------------------------------------------------
 0  | x3  |  15 |  3   |  5   |  1   |  0   | 15/3 = 5
 0  | x4  |  10 |  5   |  2   |  0   |  1   | 10/5 = 2 → smallest ratio
        </code>
    </pre>

                            <p>As 2 is the smallest ratio, x4 is the outgoing variable, and x1 will replace x4 in the
                                basis.</p>
                        </li>


                        <li>Now, we pivot on the key element (5 in the x1 column, row 2). After performing row
                            operations, the updated tableau looks like this:
                            <pre>
                                <code>
           | Cj  |   5  |   3  |   0  |   0  |
  CB | Xb  |  b  |  x1  |  x2  |  x3  |  x4  |
----------------------------------------------
  0  | x3  |   9 |  0   | 19/5 |  1   | -3/5 | (Row 1)
  5  | x1  |   2 |  1   |  2/5 |  0   |  1/5 | (Row 2)
----------------------------------------------
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                            Row 2 was divided by 5, and row 1 was updated using row 1 - 3 * (new row 2).
                        </li>

                        <li>Next, we compute Zj - Cj again:
                            <pre>
            <code>
           | Cj  |   5  |   3  |   0  |   0  |
  CB | Xb  |  b  |  x1  |  x2  |  x3  |  x4  | min ratio
--------------------------------------------------------
  0  | x3  |   9 |  0   | 19/5 |  1   | -3/5 | 45/19 → smallest ratio
  5  | x1  |   2 |  1   |  2/5 |  0   |  1/5 | 10/2
--------------------------------------------------------
       Zj  |     |  5   |  2   |  0   |  1   |
       Cj  |     |  5   |  3   |  0   |  0   |
  Zj - Cj  |     |  0   | -1   |  0   |  1   |
            </code>
        </pre>
                            The next entering variable is x2 (as -1 is the most negative value in Zj - Cj), and the
                            outgoing variable is x3 (smallest ratio). We perform another pivot operation.
                        </li>

                        <li>After performing the row operations, the final tableau is:
                            <pre>
                                <code>

  CB | Xb  |    b  |  x1  |  x2  |  x3   |  x4  |
--------------------------------------------------------
  3  | x2  | 45/19 |  0   |   1  |  5/19 |-3/19 | (Row 1) new
  5  | x1  | 20/19 |  1   |   0  | -2/19 |  5/19 | (Row 2)
--------------------------------------------------------
       Zj  |       |  5   |  3   |  5/19 | 16/19
       Cj  |       |  5   |  3   |   0   |   0
  Zj - Cj  |       |  0   |  0   |  5/19 | 16/19
                                </code>
                            </pre>
                            Since there are no more negative values in the Zj - Cj row, the optimal solution has been
                            reached.
                        </li>

                        <li>Finally, the optimal solution is:
                            <br>x1 = 20/19, x2 = 45/19
                            <br>Optimal value of Z = 5(20/19) + 3(45/19) = 225/19 ≈ 11.84

                    allows converting such constraints into a standard form suitable for solving using the Simplex
                    method.</p>

                            Since M is a large value, suppose it is 100, then the most negative value will be -8M+1. So
                            in this column, x2 is the entering variable.
                            <br>Now, we will find the minimum ratio to identify the outgoing variable.
                            <br>Row 1 ratio of b/x2 = 4/1 = 4
                            <br>Row 2 ratio of b/x2 = 7/7 = 1 (this is the minimum ratio value).
                            <br>Thus, 7 becomes our key value, and we need to make it 1.
                            <br>x6 is the outgoing variable.

                            <br>To make 7 into 1, we will perform the following operations:

                <h3>Two Phase Method</h3>
                <p>The Two-Phase Method is used to solve Linear Programming Problems (LPP) when the problem involves
                    artificial variables, typically in the case of equality constraints or greater-than-or-equal-to (≥)
                    constraints. It ensures that a feasible solution is found even when such variables are introduced.
                    The method is divided into two phases:
                <ol>
                    <li>Phase 1:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The goal is to minimize the sum of artificial variables, ensuring that they are driven
                                to zero.</li>
                            <li>The original LPP is modified by adding artificial variables and creating an auxiliary
                                objective function (minimizing the sum of these variables).</li>
                            <li>Solve the modified problem using the simplex method. If the optimal solution of the
                                auxiliary problem has a value of zero for the artificial variables, it means a feasible
                                solution is found.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Phase 2:
                        <ul>
                            <li>After obtaining a feasible solution from Phase 1, the artificial variables are removed
                                from the problem.</li>
                            <li>The original objective function is restored, and the feasible solution is used as the
                                starting point for solving the original LPP using the simplex method.</li>

                <li>In the transportation problem, we aim to minimize transportation costs for a business while
                    maximizing overall profit.</li>
                <li>Suppose you are running a business, and you need to transport materials to 4 different destinations
                    from 4 supply locations. You are aware of the transportation costs from each location, the demand at
                    each destination, and the available supply at each source. The model used to minimize the
                    transportation cost while balancing supply and demand is known as the Transportation Model.</li>
                <li>Usually, the transportation problem involves minimization, but in some cases, we may need to
                    maximize certain factors, such as profit. In such scenarios, a different approach or method is
                    applied to solve the problem effectively.</li>
            </ul>

                <p><strong>Basic Feasible Solution (BFS):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Transportation Problem is a special case of Linear Programming Problems (LPP), so the
                        definition of a Basic Feasible Solution (BFS) is similar to that in LPP.</li>
                    <li>In the case of the Transportation Problem, there are only (m + n - 1) basic variables out of a
                        total of m * n variables. Here, <em>m</em> represents the number of rows (suppliers) and
                        <em>n</em> represents the number of columns (destinations) in the transportation problem.
                        Therefore, the BFS of a transportation problem consists of at most (m + n - 1) variables, with
                        the remaining variables being zero.

                <ul>
                    <li>We will solve this using the <strong>North-West Corner Rule</strong>.</li>
                    <li>First, we check if the supply and demand are balanced. This means the total supply should equal
                        the total demand. In this case, the total capacity (7 + 9 + 18 = 34) is equal to the total
                        requirement (5 + 8 + 7 + 14 = 34), so the problem is balanced.</li>
                    <li>In the North-West Corner method, we start at the top-left (north-west) corner of the cost matrix
                        and assign the supply or demand, whichever is smaller, to that cell. We then subtract the
                        smaller value from the larger one and move to the next cell, following the north-west direction
                        until all supplies and demands are met.</li>
                    <li>
                        Start with top-left and assign smallest supply or demand.

                        We put vi or ui as zero where there are most allocated cost in a row or column. so in the above

                        <br>so transportation cost 180 is optimal. which means we can't decrease it cost less than 180.

                    one is good at dancing and last one is expert in fighting and also all of them can do each work
                    also but the work they are expertise they do it in less time so we have to figure out what work
                    to assign to which person so that overall time for completing the whole work is less.</li>

                <h3>Unbalanced Assignment Problem</h3>
                <p>In an unbalanced assignment problem, the number of rows (tasks) is not equal to the number of columns
                    (jobs). This happens when the number of tasks to be assigned differs from the number of resources or
                    workers available. To handle such cases, we convert the unbalanced problem into a balanced one by
                    adding dummy rows or columns. These dummy rows or columns are introduced with a cost of zero for all
                    their elements, ensuring that the problem becomes balanced while keeping the integrity of the
                    assignment process intact. This way, each task can still be assigned to a worker, or a job can be
                    assigned to a task, without any imbalance.
                    For example:</p>
                <pre>
    <code>
    Original Matrix (Unbalanced):
       | J1 | J2 | J3 |
-------+----+----+----+
    P1 | 15 | 20 | 35 |  
    P2 | 25 | 30 | 25 |  
-------+----+----+----+

    After adding a dummy row to balance the matrix:

    | J1 | J2 | J3 |
----+----+----+----+
 P1 | 15 | 20 | 35 |  
 P2 | 25 | 30 | 25 |  
 D1 |  0 |  0 |  0 |  
----+----+----+----+

    Now the problem is balanced, and you can apply the usual steps of row reduction, column reduction, and assignment using the Hungarian Method.

                <h3>Maximization Problem:</h3>
                <p>In assignment problems, the objective is usually to minimize the total cost. However, in some cases,
                    the goal is to maximize the total profit or benefit. These are called maximization problems. The
                    Hungarian method, which is typically used for minimization problems, can also be applied to
                    maximization problems with a slight modification.
                    To solve a maximization problem, we convert it into a minimization problem. This is done by
                    subtracting each element of the given matrix from the highest element in the matrix. This
                    transformation effectively inverts the problem, allowing us to use the same Hungarian Method steps
                    of row reduction, column reduction, and allocation for maximization problems.
                    For example:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
Original Profit Matrix (Maximization):
   | J1 | J2 | J3 |
---+----+----+----+
P1 | 50 | 60 | 40 |  
P2 | 70 | 80 | 60 |  
P3 | 65 | 55 | 45 |  
---+----+----+----+

Step 1: Find the maximum value in the matrix (which is 80 here) and subtract each element from this value:

| J1     |   J2     |   J3     |
---------+----------+----------+
80-50=30 | 80-60=20 | 80-40=40 |
80-70=10 | 80-80=0  | 80-60=20 |
80-65=15 | 80-55=25 | 80-45=35 |
---------+----------+----------+

Resulting Cost Matrix (for minimization):
     | J1 | J2 | J3 |
-----+----+----+----+
 P1  | 30 | 20 | 40 |  
 P2  | 10 |  0 | 20 |  
 P3  | 15 | 25 | 35 |  
-----+----+----+----+

                </pre>
                <p> Now, you can apply the usual steps of the Hungarian Method to this transformed matrix to find the

                    <li>No place is to be visited twice before the tour of all places is completed. This means that each

                        designated points without repetition.</li>
                    <li>Going from one place to itself is not allowed. This condition emphasizes that the salesman must
                        travel to different locations, and returning to the starting point without visiting other places
                        is not an option during the tour.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Postal Deliveries:</strong> In postal delivery systems, TSP can be used to optimize the
                        routes that delivery vehicles take to minimize travel distance and time while ensuring all
                        delivery points are reached.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inspection:</strong> TSP is applicable in scenarios where inspections are required at
                        multiple sites (e.g., infrastructure inspections), allowing inspectors to plan efficient routes
                        that cover all sites with minimal travel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cable Connection:</strong> In telecommunications and networking, TSP can help design
                        optimal routes for laying cables between multiple points, ensuring the least distance is
                        covered, which can reduce costs and time.</li>
                    <li><strong>School Bus Routes:</strong> TSP can be utilized to determine the most efficient routes
                        for school buses, ensuring that all student pickups and drop-offs are conducted with minimal
                        travel time and distance. </li>

                        <br>Note: In the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), you must visit all places exactly once, and
                        the tour must return to the starting point. The path cannot repeat the same place until the tour
                        is complete.

                    <li><strong>Row Reduction:</strong>
                        <br>We will perform row reduction by subtracting the smallest value in each row from all

        </pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Column Reduction:</strong>
                        <br>We now perform column reduction by subtracting the smallest value in each column from all
                        elements in that column:

            <code>
     |  A   |  B  |  C   |  D   |  E

        </pre>
                        Now, we try to assign paths, but there will be no complete cycle. This means the current
                        solution is not optimal.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Assigning Greater Than Zero:</strong>
                        <br>We now look for the next smallest value greater than zero, which is 1, and attempt to make
                        assignments:
                        <pre>
            <code>
     |  A  |  B  |  C   |  D  |  E

  A  |  ∞  |  1A  |  3  |  6  |  0C
  B  |  4  |  ∞   |  0C |  6  |  0A

            </code>
        </pre>
                        There is still no complete cycle, so we adjust the assignments.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Adjusting Assignments:</strong>
                        <br>We adjust the assignments further to ensure a complete cycle is formed:
                        <pre>
            <code>
     |  A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |  E
-----------------------------------                        
  A  |  ∞  |  1A |  3  |  6  |  0C
  B  |  4  |  ∞  |  0A |  6  |  0C
  C  |  4  |  3  |  ∞  |  0A |  3
  D  |  8  |  0C |  1C |  ∞  |  1A
  E  |  0A |  2  |  0C |  7  |  ∞
            </code>
        </pre>
                        The cycle is now complete: A - B - C - D - E - A, which forms the optimal solution.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Calculating the Total Cost:</strong>
                        <br>The total cost of the optimal tour is the sum of the selected paths:
                        <ul>
                            <li>From A to B: 2</li>
                            <li>From B to C: 3</li>
                            <li>From C to D: 4</li>
                            <li>From D to E: 5</li>
                            <li>From E to A: 1</li>
                        </ul>
                        So, the total TSP cost = 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 1 = 15.
