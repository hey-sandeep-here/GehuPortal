            <h2>ADO & ADO.NET</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>ADO</strong> (ActiveX Data Objects) and <strong>ADO.NET</strong> are technologies provided by
                Microsoft for accessing and managing data from databases and other sources.
                While ADO is an older technology that works in a connected manner requiring continuous interaction with
                the database,
                <strong>ADO.NET</strong> is the advanced version introduced with the .NET framework, designed to work in
                a disconnected manner, improving efficiency and performance.
            </p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3><strong>ADO (ActiveX Data Objects)</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)</strong> is a technology used to interact with databases and
                        other data sources. It provides a unified programming interface, allowing developers to use the
                        same set of objects regardless of the underlying data source.</li>
                    <li>In ADO, applications typically require <strong>long-lived database connections</strong>, which
                        means the connection to the database remains open for an extended period. This also involves
                        locking database resources.</li>
                    <li>A single <strong>Connection object</strong> is used in ADO to establish a connection to the
                        database.</li>
                    <li>Data is managed using a <strong>RecordSet</strong> object, which holds data from a single query
                        or a specific data source.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3><strong>ADO.NET</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>ADO.NET</strong> is the advanced successor to ADO, introduced as part of the .NET
                        framework. It provides consistent access to various types of data sources, such as relational
                        databases, XML files, and more.</li>
                    <li>Unlike ADO, <strong>ADO.NET does not require locking or long-lived connections</strong>. It uses
                        a disconnected architecture to improve performance and scalability.</li>
                    <li>ADO.NET uses separate objects, such as <strong>DataSets</strong> and
                        <strong>DataAdapters</strong>, to represent and manipulate data, enabling faster and more
                        efficient access.
                    </li>
                    <li>It seamlessly integrates with <strong>XML</strong>, allowing data to be represented and stored
                        in XML format.</li>

            <h2>Data Providers by .NET Framework</h2>
            <p><strong>Data Providers</strong> in .NET Framework are components that enable applications to interact
                with data sources such as SQL Server, Oracle, and others. They manage the connection to the data source,
                execute commands, and retrieve results. Each provider is designed to work with a specific type of data
                source.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>.NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server:</strong> This provider is optimized for
                    accessing Microsoft SQL Server. It requires the <strong>System.Data.SqlClient</strong> namespace and
                    provides efficient and secure access to SQL Server databases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>.NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB:</strong> This provider is used to connect to data
                    sources that use OLE DB (Object Linking and Embedding, Database). It requires the
                    <strong>System.Data.OleDb</strong> namespace and is ideal for accessing legacy databases.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>.NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC:</strong> ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) is a
                    standard API for accessing database management systems. This provider is used to connect to data
                    sources using ODBC drivers and requires the <strong>System.Data.Odbc</strong> namespace.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>.NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle:</strong> This provider is specifically designed to
                    work with Oracle databases. It requires the <strong>System.Data.OracleClient</strong> namespace
                    (deprecated in recent .NET versions but still relevant for legacy systems).
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>.NET Framework Data Provider Objects</h2>
            <p>The .NET Framework data provider includes several core objects that work together to manage data
                operations:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Connection:</strong> Used to establish and manage a connection to a data source. For
                    example, a connection to a SQL Server database is established using a <strong>SqlConnection</strong>
                    object.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Command:</strong> Used to execute SQL queries or stored procedures against a database.
                    Examples include <strong>SqlCommand</strong> for SQL Server and <strong>OleDbCommand</strong> for
                    OLE DB.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Reader:</strong> Provides a forward-only, read-only access to data retrieved from a
                    database. For instance, <strong>SqlDataReader</strong> is used with SQL Server.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Adapter:</strong> Acts as a bridge between a database and a <strong>DataSet</strong>.
                    It is used to retrieve data from the database and update it back after modifications.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>The data provider model in .NET is flexible and allows developers to interact with various types of
                databases using namespaces and classes tailored for specific database technologies. By using these
                providers, developers can write data-driven applications efficiently and maintain compatibility with
                different data sources.</p>
