            <h2>Data Link Layer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Data Link Layer serves a crucial role in computer networks by facilitating the transmission of
                    data between two devices or nodes.</li>
                <li>It is divided into two main parts: Data Link Control and Multiple Access Resolution/Protocol.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Link Control:</strong> This upper layer is responsible for flow control and error
                    control within the data link layer. It ensures the reliable and orderly transfer of data between
                    connected devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Access Resolution/Protocol:</strong> The lower sub-layer focuses on handling and
                    minimizing collisions or multiple access issues on a communication channel. It is often referred to
                    as Media Access Control (MAC) or Multiple Access Resolutions.</li>

            <p>The <strong>Data Link Control (DLC)</strong> component ensures the integrity of data transmission by
                managing flow control and error control. Flow control regulates the pace of data exchange between
                devices to prevent overwhelming the receiving end. Error control mechanisms detect and correct errors
                that may occur during transmission, ensuring the accuracy of the transmitted data.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Media Access Control (MAC)</strong> or <strong>Multiple Access Resolutions</strong> component
                of the Data Link Layer addresses challenges related to channel access. It handles and reduces
                collisions, ensuring that multiple devices on the network can efficiently share the communication
                channel without interference.</p>

                    Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) for point-to-point communication.</li>
                <li>Efficient data link layer protocols contribute to overall network performance, as they directly
                    impact the reliability and speed of data transmission.</li>

                    <p><strong>Basic Steps:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Sender Side:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The sender sends a frame to the receiver.</li>
                                <li>Waits for an acknowledgment (ACK) from the receiver.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Receiver Side:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Receives the frame.</li>
                                <li>Sends an acknowledgment (ACK) back to the sender.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Sender Side (After ACK):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the ACK is received within a specified timeout period, the sender assumes
                                    successful delivery and proceeds to send the next frame.</li>
                                <li>If the ACK is not received within the timeout period, the sender retransmits the

                    <p><strong>Issues and Limitations:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Low Efficiency: Stop-and-Wait is not very efficient, especially in scenarios where there is
                            a significant delay between the sender and receiver. While waiting for an acknowledgment,
                            the sender is idle, leading to low utilization of the communication link.</li>
                        <li>Limited Bandwidth Utilization: The sender cannot transmit a new frame until it receives an
                            acknowledgment for the previous one. This results in underutilization of the available
                            bandwidth.</li>
                        <li>Increased Latency: The round-trip time (RTT) heavily influences the protocol's performance.
                            Higher RTT can lead to increased latency, affecting the overall throughput.</li>

                <li>Point-to-point connection between two devices using a wire.</li>
                <li>Data is transmitted as a stream of bits and needs to be framed into discernible blocks.</li>
                <li>Framing organizes and controls the transmission of data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frame Structure:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data link layer technologies (Ethernet, token ring, frame relay) have distinct frame structures.

            <h3>Advantages of Using Frames:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Data is broken into recoverable chunks, facilitating easy corruption checks.</li>
                <li>Organized and controlled transmission ensures accurate and efficient data delivery.</li>

                        <li>When a sender and receiver have a dedicated link, DLC manages the channel effectively.</li>
                        <li>In scenarios without a dedicated path, multiple stations share a common channel, leading to
                            simultaneous data transmission.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li><b>Multiple Access Protocol:</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Becomes crucial in scenarios with no dedicated link, preventing collisions and crosstalk.
                        </li>
                        <li>Orchestrates the access of multiple stations to the channel, ensuring orderly and efficient

            <p>For instance, consider a classroom scenario where students represent small channels. When a teacher asks
                a question, all students attempt to answer simultaneously, akin to transferring data concurrently. This
                simultaneous response can lead to data overlap or loss. In this analogy, the teacher acts as the
                multiple access protocol, managing the students to ensure a coherent and organized response.</p>

                        <li>CSMA/CA is a network protocol that combines carrier sensing with collision
                            avoidance for the transmission of data frames. Operating at the medium access control layer,
                            it employs acknowledgment signals to ensure successful transmission and avoid collisions.
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Protocol Mechanism:</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When a data frame is sent to the channel, the station awaits acknowledgment to check
                                    channel status.</li>
                                <li>If the station receives a single acknowledgment (its own), the data frame is
                                    successfully transmitted to the receiver.</li>
                                <li>If two signals are received (its own and one indicating collision), a collision has
                                    occurred in the shared channel.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li><b>Interframe Space (IFS):</b> The station waits for the channel to become idle. If
                                    the channel is idle, it does not immediately send data but waits for a defined
                                    Interframe Space (IFS) to prioritize station access.</li>

                                <li><b>Contention Window:</b> The total time is divided into different slots. When ready
                                    to transmit, the station selects a random slot as wait time. If the channel is still
                                    busy, it restarts the timer for sending data packets when the channel is inactive.
                                </li>

                                <li><b>Acknowledgment:</b> The sender sends the data frame to the shared channel only if

                    <li>Controlled Access Protocol is a method aimed at reducing data frame collisions
                        on a shared channel. In this method, each station collaborates to determine which station has

                        <li>Each station is assigned a slot in the reservation interval, and if a

                            has data to send, it transmits a bit in its designated slot.</li>
                        <li>After all slots are checked, stations know which others wish to transmit,
