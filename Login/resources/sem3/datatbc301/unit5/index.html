        <h1>Transport Layer</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The network layer is responsible for host-to-host communication at the computer level, delivering
                messages only to the destination computer.</li>
            <li>However, this delivery is incomplete, as the message still needs to be directed to the specific
                computer process. Therefore, the primary role of the transport layer is to provide communication
                services directly to the application processes running on different hosts.</li>
            <li>The transport layer establishes a logical communication channel between application processes on
                different hosts. Despite not being physically connected, application processes utilize the logical
                communication facilitated by the transport layer to exchange messages.</li>
            <li>For instance, when using WhatsApp on a mobile phone, the connection between two phones is
                established by the network layer, but the communication between my WhatsApp application and my
                friend's WhatsApp application is facilitated by the transport layer.

            </li>
            <li>The transport layer protocol is specifically responsible for delivering messages to the appropriate
                process. It ensures end-to-end or process-to-process communication, addressing the intricacies
                (complexities) of
                connecting and communicating between specific applications running on different hosts.</li>
            <li>
                Common transport layer protocols include Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User
                Datagram Protocol (UDP), each offering different features and trade-offs in terms of
                reliability and speed.</li>
            <li>Transport layer protocols use port numbers to identify specific processes on a host,
                enabling the correct delivery of messages to the intended applications.</li>
            <li>Through flow control and error detection mechanisms, the transport layer ensures reliable
                and ordered delivery of messages between applications.</li>
            <li>Transport layer services contribute to the abstraction of the underlying network
                complexities, allowing application developers to focus on high-level communication without
                worrying about the complexities of network configuration.</li>

            <h2>Connection-Oriented and Connectionless Services in Transport Layer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Connection-Oriented Services:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Connection-oriented services in the transport layer involve the establishment of a
                            dedicated, reliable, and ordered communication channel before data exchange begins.</li>
                        <li>These services ensure a virtual circuit or connection is established between the sender
                            and receiver, providing a reliable and predictable data transfer mechanism.</li>
                        <li>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a prime example of a connection-oriented
                            protocol, offering features such as acknowledgment, flow control, and error checking to
                            ensure the integrity of data delivery.</li>
                        <li>Connection-oriented services are suitable for applications where data accuracy,
                            sequencing, and completeness are critical, such as file transfer and web browsing.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Connectionless Services:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Connectionless services in the transport layer involve communication without the
                            establishment of a dedicated connection beforehand.</li>
                        <li>These services are faster and less resource-intensive but do not guarantee ordered or
                            error-checked delivery of data.</li>
                        <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a classic example of a connectionless protocol,
                            providing a lightweight and quick data transfer mechanism without the overhead of
                            connection setup and maintenance.</li>
                        <li>Connectionless services are suitable for real-time applications, such as online gaming,
                            live streaming, and voice over IP (VoIP), where speed is prioritized over guaranteed
                            data delivery.</li>

                    <strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked
                            delivery of data between applications.</li>
                        <li>It establishes a virtual circuit or connection between the sender and receiver before
                            exchanging data, ensuring that data is delivered accurately and in the correct order.
                        </li>
                        <li>TCP includes features such as flow control, acknowledgment of received data, and
                            retransmission of lost or corrupted packets to guarantee the integrity of the
                            communication.</li>
                        <li>Example: Web browsing, file transfer (e.g., FTP), and email (e.g., SMTP) commonly use
                            TCP to ensure accurate and complete data delivery.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li>
                    <strong>User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>UDP is a connectionless protocol that provides faster, simpler, and less reliable
                            communication compared to TCP.</li>
                        <li>It does not establish a dedicated connection before data transfer, and it does not
                            perform error checking or retransmission of lost packets.</li>
                        <li>UDP is suitable for applications where speed and low overhead are prioritized over
                            guaranteed data delivery, such as real-time applications like online gaming, live
                            streaming, and voice over IP (VoIP).</li>
                        <li>Example: Domain Name System (DNS) uses UDP for quick and lightweight communication to
                            resolve domain names to IP addresses.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <strong>Comparison:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TCP is ideal for applications that require reliable, ordered, and error-checked
                            delivery, making it suitable for scenarios where data accuracy is crucial.</li>
                        <li>UDP, on the other hand, is suitable for applications where speed and simplicity are
                            prioritized, and occasional packet loss or disorder is acceptable.</li>
                        <li>The choice between TCP and UDP depends on the specific requirements of the application
                            and the trade-offs between reliability and speed.</li>

            <h2>Services provided by the Transport Layer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The services offered by the transport layer share similarities with those of the data link
                    layer. While the data link layer operates within a single network, the transport layer extends
                    its services across an internetwork, encompassing multiple interconnected networks. Unlike the
                    data link layer, which governs the physical layer, the transport layer exercises control over
                    all the lower layers of the OSI model.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The services provided by transport layer protocols can be categorized into five main areas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>End-to-End Delivery:</strong> Ensuring the reliable delivery of messages between the
                    source and destination, regardless of the number of intermediate networks.</li>
                <li><strong>Addressing:</strong> Managing the addressing scheme to identify the source and
                    destination processes in the communication.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reliable Delivery:</strong> Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data delivery
                    through:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Error Control: Detecting and correcting errors in transmitted data.</li>
                        <li>Sequence Control: Maintaining the correct order of data packets during transmission.
                        </li>
                        <li>Loss Control: Minimizing data loss during the transmission process.</li>
                        <li>Duplication Control: Preventing the occurrence of duplicated data packets.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Flow Control:</strong> Managing the rate of data transmission to prevent overwhelming
                    the receiving device or network.</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Multiplexing:</strong> Efficiently handling multiple communication streams through:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Upward Multiplexing: Combining data streams from multiple processes into a single
                            communication channel.</li>
                        <li>Downward Multiplexing: Distributing data streams from a single source process to
                            multiple destination processes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) operates at the Transport Layer and is an integral part of the
                    Internet Protocol suite, commonly known as UDP/IP suite.</li>
                <li>Unlike Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), UDP is characterized as an unreliable and
                    connectionless protocol. Consequently, there is no need to establish a dedicated connection
                    before initiating data transfer.</li>
                <li>While TCP is the predominant transport layer protocol for most Internet services, providing
                    guaranteed delivery, reliability, and additional features, these benefits come with added
                    overhead and latency.</li>
                <li>UDP, on the other hand, plays a crucial role in scenarios that demand real-time services, such
                    as online gaming, voice or video communication, and live conferences. In these applications,
                    where high performance is paramount, UDP allows packets to be dropped instead of processing
                    delayed packets. Notably, UDP lacks error checking, resulting in bandwidth savings.</li>
                <li>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) stands out for its efficiency in terms of both latency and
                    bandwidth, making it a preferred choice for time-sensitive and performance-critical
                    applications.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The UDP header is a fixed and simple 8-byte structure, in contrast to TCP, which can vary in
                        size from 20 to 60 bytes.</li>
                    <li>The first 8 bytes of the UDP header contain all the necessary information, while the
                        remaining part is dedicated to data transmission.</li>
                    <li>UDP port number fields are each 16 bits long, allowing for a port number range defined from
                        0 to 65535. Port number 0 is reserved for special purposes. These port numbers play a
                        crucial role in distinguishing between different user requests or processes.</li>

                        different devices within a network. These services can encompass tasks such as data formatting,
                        encryption, decryption, authentication, and other application-specific functionalities.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Application layer protocols enable communication and data exchange between software applications on
                different devices.</li>
            <li>Examples of Application Layer protocols include HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple
                Mail Transfer Protocol), and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).</li>
            <li>These protocols define the rules and conventions for communication, ensuring seamless interaction
                between applications running on diverse devices.</li>
            <li>One practical example illustrating the role of the Application Layer is the communication between
                users on WhatsApp. When you send a message on WhatsApp, the application layer protocols manage the
                process of composing, sending, and receiving messages, providing a user-friendly and efficient
                communication experience.</li>
            <li>The Application Layer encapsulates the complexities of network communication, allowing diverse
                applications to interact without being concerned with the underlying network details.</li>

            <h2>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>SMTP is an application layer protocol designed for efficiently and reliably sending emails over
                    the internet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Working:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The SMTP server is consistently in a listening mode, ready to handle incoming connections.</li>
                <li>A client initiates a TCP connection with the SMTP server.</li>
                <li>The SMTP server listens for a connection and establishes a connection on the designated port.
                </li>
                <li>Once the connection is established, the client informs the SMTP server of its intention to send
                    an email.</li>
                <li>Upon confirmation, the client sends the email to its mail server through the SMTP server.</li>
                <li>SMTP facilitates the transfer of the email from the sender's mail server to the receiver's mail
                    server.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/smtpd1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>SMTP is involved in the email transmission process twice:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Between the sender and the sender's mail server.</li>
                        <li>Between the sender's mail server and the receiver's mail server.</li>

                <h3>Characteristics of SMTP</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Push Protocol:</strong> SMTP operates as a push protocol, meaning it initiates the
                        transfer of data without waiting for a request. It actively pushes emails from the sender to
                        the receiver.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transport Layer:</strong> SMTP utilizes TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) at the
                        transport layer, ensuring reliable and orderly data transmission.</li>
                    <li><strong>Port Number:</strong> SMTP uses port number 25 to establish communication between
                        the sender and the recipient's mail server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistent TCP Connections:</strong> SMTP employs persistent TCP connections,
                        allowing it to send multiple emails in a single connection, which enhances efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Connection Oriented:</strong> SMTP is a connection-oriented protocol, establishing a
                        dedicated connection between the sender and the mail server for the duration of the email
                        transfer.</li>
                    <li><strong>In-Band Protocol:</strong> SMTP is an in-band protocol, meaning the control
                        information and data share the same communication channel. This simplifies the communication
                        process but may limit scalability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stateless Protocol:</strong> SMTP is a stateless protocol, implying that each email
                        transaction is independent. The server does not retain information about the previous
                        interactions, treating each email as a new transaction.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Important Points about SMTP</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Text-Based Protocol:</strong> SMTP is a pure text-based protocol, meaning it can
                        only handle messages containing 7-bit ASCII text. It is not designed to transfer other types
                        of data like images, video, audio, executable files, binary objects, or text data in
                        languages represented in 8-bit codes such as French, Japanese, Chinese, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>MIME Extension:</strong> Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) extends the
                        limited capabilities of SMTP. It is an extension to the internet email protocol designed to
                        enable users to send and receive graphics, audio files, video files, and other non-text data
                        within email messages. MIME was specially designed for SMTP.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stateless Protocol:</strong> SMTP is a stateless protocol, meaning it does not
                        maintain the state of its clients. If an email is requested to be sent twice, the SMTP
                        server resends it without recognizing that the email has already been sent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Receiver's Side:</strong> SMTP is not used at the receiver's side. Instead, a pull
                        protocol like POP3 or IMAP is needed. The receiver periodically checks if there are any new
                        emails from the mail server.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sender and Receiver Machines:</strong> SMTP is not run directly between sender and
                        receiver machines. This is because machines cannot always be ON. The functionality has been
                        divided between the client and the mail server. The mail server receives the mail on behalf
                        of its client and manages the client's mailbox.</li>
                    <li><strong>Client Authentication:</strong> SMTP is not suitable for client authentication, as
                        it does not require authentication. It allows anyone on the Internet to send emails to
                        anyone or even to a large group of people. SMTP Auth, short for SMTP Authentication, has
                        been introduced separately to provide authentication features.</li>

                    on the World Wide Web.</li>
                <li>In simple words, HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the foundation of data communication on
                    the World Wide Web. It is a set of rules that allows web browsers and servers to communicate. When
                    you type a web address (URL) into your browser and hit Enter, your browser uses HTTP to request the
                    web page from the server. The server then sends back the requested web page, and your browser
                    displays it for you to see. HTTP is like a language that enables the exchange of information between

                            <li>TCP guarantees retransmission of lost packets, providing a reliable communication
                                channel.</li>
                            <li>HTTP lacks built-in reliability features, necessitating the use of TCP for reliable
                                data transfer.</li>

                    <li>HTTP uses port number 80.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTTP clients use port 80 to send and receive requested web pages from an HTTP server.
                        </li>

                        <li>Persistent connections, as in HTTP 1.1, improve performance by 20% compared to

                        <li>After serving a single HTTP request, the connection is closed and not reused.</li>
                        <li>HTTP 1.0 without connection keep-alive is considered connectionless.</li>

            <h2>File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>FTP is an application layer protocol.</li>
                <li>In simple words, FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, is a way to move files from one computer to another over the internet. It's like a digital courier service. If you have a file on your computer that you want to share or send to someone else, you can use FTP to upload (send) that file to a server on the internet. The other person can then use FTP to download (receive) the file from the same server. It's a convenient method for sharing files between computers, especially when the computers are not physically close to each other.</li>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Purpose:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>FTP is designed for exchanging files over the internet.</li>
                    <li>It facilitates users in uploading and downloading files from the internet.</li>

                <h3>Working:</h3>
                <p>FTP establishes two TCP connections between the client and the server:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>One connection is dedicated to transferring data.</li>
                    <li>The other connection is utilized for transferring control information.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="../../images/ftpd1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            </div>

            <p><strong>Additional Information:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>FTP operates on two modes: Active mode and Passive mode.
                    <ul>
                        <li>In Active mode, the client initiates the connection, and the server responds.</li>
                        <li>In Passive mode, the server initiates the data connection, and the client responds.
                            Passive mode is useful when the client is behind a firewall.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>FTP uses different commands for controlling the file transfer operations, such as RETR (retrieve
                    a copy of the file) and STOR (store a copy of the file).</li>
                <li>FTP can work with or without user authentication, depending on the server's configuration.</li>
                <li>Security concerns with FTP have led to the development of more secure alternatives, such as SFTP
                    (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and FTPS (FTP Secure).</li>

                <h3>Characteristics of FTP</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>FTP uses TCP at the transport layer:</strong> FTP relies on the Transmission Control
                        Protocol (TCP) for reliable communication between the client and server.</li>
                    <li><strong>FTP uses port number 21 for the control connection:</strong> Port 21 is designated
                        for the control connection, where commands and responses between the client and server are
                        exchanged.</li>
                    <li><strong>FTP uses port number 20 for the data connection:</strong> Port 20 is reserved for
                        the data connection, facilitating the actual transfer of files between the client and
                        server.</li>
                    <li><strong>FTP establishes persistent TCP connections for the control connection:</strong> The
                        control connection remains open throughout the FTP session, handling commands, and
                        responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>FTP uses non-persistent connections for the data connection:</strong> The data
                        connection is established as needed for file transfers and closed after the transfer is
                        complete.</li>
                    <li><strong>FTP is a connection-oriented protocol:</strong> FTP maintains a connection between
                        the client and server, ensuring a reliable exchange of commands and data.</li>
                    <li><strong>FTP is an out-of-band protocol:</strong> FTP uses separate connections for control
                        information (out-of-band) and data, enhancing efficiency and flexibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>FTP is not mentioned as SMTP; it is a stateful protocol:</strong> FTP maintains the
                        state of the session, remembering user login information and the current working directory.
                    </li>

                <h3>Important Notes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Emails can't be sent using FTP.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>FTP requires the establishment of a connection between the client and server before
                                transferring files.</li>
                            <li>Both the client and server need to be online simultaneously for FTP file transfers.
                            </li>
                            <li>Due to this requirement, emails are not sent using FTP.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>FTP can transfer one file at a time.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>FTP is designed for transferring a single file at a time in either direction between
                                the client and server.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>FTP is a stateful protocol.</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The client establishes a control connection for the duration of an FTP session.</li>
                            <li>FTP sessions typically span multiple data transfers, making it a stateful protocol.
                            </li>
