                <li>Attitude express our evaluations or judgements concerning objects, people or events. The statements may be favourable or unfavourable.</li>
                <li>Our attitudes are based on information. They reflect how one feels, thinks, perceives and acts about something.</li>
                <li>Definition by Schermerhorm: Attitude is a predisposition to respond in a positive or negative way to someone or something in one's environment.</li>

                <h3>Characteristics of Attitude</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attitudes affect the behaviour of an individual. They are expressed by terms such as liking-disliking, pro-anti, favouring-not favouring, and positive-negative.</li>
                    <li>Attitudes are acquired through learning over a period of time. The process of learning starts right from childhood and continues throughout the life of a person.</li>
                    <li>Attitude constitute a psychological phenomenon which cannot be observed by the behaviour of an individual.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Three components of attitude</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cognitive components &rarr; The thought, opinion or belief segment of an attitude. For example, "The belief that discrimination is wrong", is a value statement. It is a cognitive component.</li>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>SWOC analysis is a strategic method used to research external & internal factors which affect company's success and growth.</li>
                    <li>Firms use SWOC analysis to determine the strength, weakness, opportunities, and challenges of their firm, products, and competetion.</li>
                    <li>S &rarr; Strength
                        <br>W &rarr; Weakness 
                        <br>O &rarr; Opportunities
                        <br>C &rarr; Challenges
                    </li>
                    <li>SWOC analysis is relevant to SWOT Analysis</li>
                    <li>SWOT focuses on Threats rather than challenges.</li>
                    <li>the two are somewhat similar but they do have their differences, which is why firms may choose to use SWOT over SWOC.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>How to use SWOC analysis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When begining a SWOC analysis of a product or firm, you must go through each section individually</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p>1- Strength</p>
                    <p>Strength are features which benefit the company, such as product rules, strengths can also be more abstract. <br>Example:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you have decided to build a product because you know you can offer it cheaper than your compitor, this is an overall strength of the company.</li>
                        <li>If you have records of better customer service via positive reviews online, this is a strength you can use it to your advantage.</li>
                        <li>Strength can be documented through statistics, customer service reviews and surveys.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p>2- Weakness</p>
                    <p>The next step is noticing weakness causes a company to struggle. <br>For example</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you have decided to target a younger audience but your packaging is still dedicated to senior citizens, the new consumer base will struggle to connect to the product. This will be shown in reports and can cause an internal struggle within the company. <br>Weakness need to be documented and acknowledged to handle them promptly before it spreads and leads to overall destruction.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p>3- Opportunities</p>
                    <p>Opportunities are often external. They provide firms to grow successfully. <br>For example:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A digital marketing agency helps a client develop an effective email marketing strategy. The agency has been thinking of adding other modes of digital marketing, like social media. This is an opportunity for the agency to develop a new section of their business without having to create a marketing plan because they can reach out to existing clients. <br>
                            Being open to opportunities, knowing when to look for them, and knowing how to act on them can boost a firm's success. <br>
                            Documenting past opportunities can help create a plan on how to capitalise on future ones.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p>4- Challenges</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The final step in SWOC analysis is acknowledging challenges.</li>
                        <li>this is how SWOC and SWOT analysis differ because SWOT analysis focuses on threats.</li>
                        <li>Challenges are similar to threats but have the chance of being overcome.</li>
                        <li>Threats have the potential to damage a firm, but challenges often already exist and need to be handled.</li>
                        <li>This step is crucial.</li>
                        <li>If you have already examined the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities but have skipped assessing the challenges, you may be on the path to failure.
                        </li>
                        <li>Challenges can greatly undermine any progress you have made, so by ignoring this step you have opened yourself up to potential failure.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>When to use SWOC Analysis</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use SWOC analysis whenever you have a business idea, whether its starting a brand new business, a product or a product upgrade.
                </li>
                <li>One can do SWOC analysis annually, quarterly, or monthly. It depends on what product or idea you're using SWOC analysis for.</li>
                <li>But if you chose to do SWOC analysis, you must remember that it is a great cost-effective way to reduce challenges and deter failure of a business venture or product.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In short, SWOC analysis is must for each and every organization as it makes the strengths, weakness, opportunitites and challenges crystall clear.</li>
                <li>The strategies/policies can be implimented accordingly.</li>
