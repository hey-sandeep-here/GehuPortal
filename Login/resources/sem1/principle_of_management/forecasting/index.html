        <h1>Forecasting</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>"Estimation or prediction of future" is refferred to as forecasting. The prediction of outcomes, trends,
                or expected future behaviour of a business, industry secter, or the economy through the use of
                statistics.</li>
            <li>Forecasting is an operational research technique used as a basis for management planning and decision
                making.</li>
            <li>Meaning &darr;
                <ul>
                    <li>Forecasting is a systematic guessing of the future course of events.</li>
                    <li>Forecasting provides a basis for a planning.</li>
                    <li>According to Henry Fayol, forecasting includes both accessing the future and making provision
                        for it.</li>
                </ul>

                <li>It is concerned with future events.
                </li>
                <li>It is necessary for planning process.</li>
                <li>The impact of future events has to be considered in the planning process.</li>
                <li>It is a guessing of future events.</li>
                <li>It considers all the factors which affect organizational functions.</li>

            <h2>Process of forecasting</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Thorough preparation of foundation &rarr; the very purpose of thorough preparation of a foundation
                    is that the forecasting is based on the foundation.</li>
                <li>Estimation of future &rarr; the brightness of future period can be estimated in consultation with
                    the key personnel & it may be communicated to all the employees of business unit.</li>
                <li>Collection of results &rarr; relevant records are prepared & maintained to collect the result.</li>
                <li>Comparision of results &rarr; the actual results are compared with estimated results to know
                    deviations. This will help the management to estimate the future.</li>
                <li>Refining the forecast &rarr; the forecast can be refined in the light of deviations which seem to be
                    more realistic.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Importance of forecasting</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Pivot role in an organization &rarr; many organization have failed because of lack of forecasting or
                    faulty forecasting. The reason is that planning is based on accurate forecasting.</li>
                <li>Development of a business &rarr; the performance of specified objectives depends upon the proper
                    forecasting. So the development of a business or an organization is fully based on the forecasting.
                </li>
                <li>Co-ordination &rarr; forecasting helps to collect the information about internal and external
                    factors. Thus, collected information provides a basis for co-ordination.</li>
                <li>Effective control &rarr; Through forecasting, management can ascertain the strengths and weaknesses
                    of subordinates or employees.</li>

                    experience. Forecasting helps an entrepreneur to gain experience and ensures him success.</li>
                <li>Primacy (foremost) to planning &rarr; the information required for planning is supplied by
                    forecasting. So, forecasting is the primacy to the planning.</li>

            <h2>Advantages of forecasting</h2>

                <h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Regression analysis is used to find out the effect of changes of the relative movements of two
                        or more inter-related variables. In the modern business conditions and situations, number of
                        factor are responsible for the changes made in the variables.
                    </li>
                    <li>For example , if we take two inter related variables viz. cost of production and profit, there
                        will be a direct relationship prevailing between this two variables. It is possible to have an
                        estimate of profit on the basis of cost of production, provided other things remain the same.

                <ul>
                    <li>Index numbers are used to measure the state of business conditions between two or more periods.
                        Business trends, seasonal fluctuations, and cyclical movements are studied with the help of

                <ul>
                    <li>Under this method, a forecast can be made if the relationship between input and output is known
                        . At the same time, the input requirements can be forecast of the basis of output. In other
                        words, input can be determined on the basis of need of output.

                <ul>
                    <li>This method is quite accurate where future is expected to be similar to the past. Time series
                        analysis can be applied. Only when the data are available for a long period of time.

                <ul>
                    <li>Rand corporation has developed the Delphi method initially in 1969 to forecast the military
                        events. Then, it has been applied in other areas also.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Delphi method is useful when past data are not available and where the past data don’t give an
                        indication for the future events.
