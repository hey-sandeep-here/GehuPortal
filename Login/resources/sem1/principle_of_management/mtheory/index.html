        <h1>Motivational Theories</h1>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Theory X and Theory Y</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In 1960s, Douglas McGregor proposed two theories related to employee motivation and management. His
                    theories divided employees into two categories.</li>
                <li>Theory X employees avoid work and dislike responsibility. In order to motivate them, employers need
                    to enforce rules and implement punishments.</li>
                <li>Theory Y employees enjoy putting forth effort at work when they have control over opportunities for
                    employees to take on responsibility and show creativity as a way of motivating theory Y employees.
                </li>
                <li>A third theory, Theory Z was developed which encourages group work and social interaction to
                    motivate employees in the workplace.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Maslow's Hierarchy of needs</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>It contains five levels that often shape motivation styles in an organization.</li>
                <li>To motivate employees, an organization must move up the pyramid of needs to ensure all of an
                    employee's needs are met.</li>
                <li>the bottom of pyramid contains physiological needs such as food, sleep and shelter. Safety makes up
                    the second level and belonging the third.</li>
                <li>The top two levels of the pyramid include esteem and self-actualization. Successful organizations
                    focus on the top two levels of the pyramid by providing employees wih the necessary recognition and
                    developing opportunities for employees to feel they are doing valuable work and reaching their
                    potential with the company.</li>
