            <ul>
                <li>Designing is the first step for obtaining solution of a given problem.</li>
                <li>The purpose of designing is to represent solution for a system.</li>
                <li>It is difficult to design a large system because the complexity of system cannot be represented
                    easily.
                <li>Thus various methods have been evolved for designing.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Top-Down design method starts from top-level component to lowest level (bottom) component.</li>
                    <li>In this design method, the system is divided into some major components.</li>
                    <li>Then each major component is divided into lower level components.</li>
                    <li>Similarly other components are divided till the lowest level component.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Bottom-Up design method is the reverse of Top-Down approach. It starts from the lowest level
                        component to the highest-level component.</li>
                    <li>It first designs the basic components and from these basic components the higher level component
                        is designed.</li>
                    <li>Object-oriented language such as C++ or java uses a bottom-up approach where each object is
                        identified first.</li>

                    <li>It is better to divide a large system into modules.</li>
                    <li>In terms of programming, module is logically a well-defined part of program.</li>
                    <li>Each module is a separate part of the program.</li>
                    <li>It is easy to modify a program written with modular approach because changes in one module don't
                        affect other modules of program.</li>
                    <li>It is also easy to check bugs in the program in module level programming.</li>

            <h2>What is programming language?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming languages are the tools we use to write instructions for computers to follow.</li>
                <li>Programming languages allow us to translate the 1s and 0s into something that humans can understand
                    and write.</li>
                <li>Programming language is made up of series of symbols that serves as a bridge that allow humans to
                    translate our thoughts into instructions computers can understand.</li>

                    <p><b>Low level languages</b></p>
                    <p>The languages in this category are the Machine level language and Assembly language.</p>
                    <div class="in">
                        <p>Machine Level Language</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Computers can understand only digits signals, which are in binary digits i.e. 0 and 1.
                            </li>
                            <li>So the instructions given to the computer can be only in binary codes.</li>
                            <li>The machine language consists of instructions that are in binary 0 or 1.</li>
                            <li>Computers can understand only machine level language.</li>
                            <li>Writing a program in machine level language is a difficult task because it is not easy
                                for
                                programmers to write instructions in binary code.</li>
                            <li>A machine level language program is error-prone and its maintenance is very difficult.
                            </li>
                            <li>Furthermore machine language programs are not portable.</li>
                            <li>Every computer has its own machine instructions, so the programs written for one
                                computer
                                are not valid for other computers.</li>

                    <div class="in">
                        <p>Assembly Language</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The difficulties faced in machine level language were reduced to some extent by using a
                                modified form of machine level language called assembly language.</li>
                            <li>In assembly language instructions are given in English like words, such as MOV, ADD, SUB
                                etc. So it is easier-to write and understand assembly programs.
                            </li>
                            <li>Since a computer can
                                understand
                                only machine level language, assembly language program must be translated into machine
                                language.</li>
                            <li>The translator that is used for translating is called 'assembler'.</li>
                            <li>Although writing programs in assembly language is a bit easier, the programmer has to
                                know
                                all the lower level details related with the hardware of a computer.</li>
                            <li>In assembly language, data is stored in computer registers and each computer has
                                diiferent
                                set of registers. Thus the assembly language program is also not portable.</li>
                            <li>Since the low level languages are related with the hardware, the execution of a
                                low-level
                                program is faster.</li>

                        <li>High level languages are designed keeping in mind the features of portability i.e. these
                            languages are machine independent.</li>
                        <li>These are English like languages, so it is easy to write and understand the programs of
                            high-level language.</li>
                        <li>While programming in a high level language, the programmer is not concerned with the low
                            level details, and so the whole attention can be paid to the logic of the problem being
                            solved.</li>
                        <li>For translating a high-level language program into machine language, compiler or interpreter
                            is used.</li>
                        <li>Every language has its own compiler or interpreter.</li>

                            A <b>compiler</b> searches all the errors of a program and lists them, while an
                            <b>interpreter</b> checks the errors of a program statement by statement.

                        <li>
                            If the program is error-free, the <b>compiler</b> converts the entire code into machine
                            code, which can then be executed by separate commands. In contrast, after checking one
                            statement, the <b>interpreter</b> converts that statement into machine code and then
                            executes it.

                            This process continues for the <b>interpreter</b> until the last statement of the program or

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Procedural Programming</b> deals with algorithms and divides programs into functions, while
                    <b>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> deals with data and divides programs into objects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Procedural programming needs less memory and follows a top-down approach. In contrast, OOP requires
                    more memory and follows a bottom-up approach.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In procedural programming, overloading is not possible, making it less secure, and data hiding is
                    not possible. On the other hand, OOP allows function and operator overloading, is highly secure, and
                    enables data hiding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Procedural programming is derived from structured programming, based on the concept of calling
                    procedures, which consist of a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure
                    might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.
                    Common languages used in procedural programming include FORTRAN, ALGOL, COBOL, BASIC, PASCAL, and C.
                </li>
                <li>
                    OOP is based on the concept of objects, which contain data in the form of attributes and code in the
                    form of methods. Programs are designed using objects that interact with the real world. Most popular
                    OOP languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, determining their
                    types. Common OOP languages include Java, C++, C#, Python, PHP, JavaScript, Ruby, Perl, Objective-C,
                    Dart, Swift, and Scala.

                <ul>
                    <li>C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that make-up the
                        operating system.</li>
                    <li>C was adopted as a system development language because it produces code that runs nearly as fast
                        as code written in assembly language.</li>
                    <li>Some example of the use of C might be :
                        <ul>
                            <li>Operating System</li>

                <p><b>Characteristics of 'C'</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It has a very small size.</li>
                    <li>The major use of function calls in it.</li>
                    <li>It is a structured language.</li>
                    <li>It has the ability to read low level (Bitwise) programming.</li>
                    <li>The large use of pointers for memory, array, structures and functions.</li>
                    <li>High-level constructs.</li>
                    <li>The program written in C is efficient.</li>
                    <li>C can be compiled on a variety of computers.</li>
                    <li>The C programming language is used to write a variety of applications so that we can say that it
                        is a general-purpose programming language. It is a "System programming language".</li>
                    <li>C supports modular programming means a big program can divide into different modules or
                        functions.</li>
                    <li>It is also a standalone programming language. Due to these characteristics of C it is most
                        popular.</li>
                    <li>C has very fast compilation and execution in comparision to other programming languages.</li>
                    <li>C is easy and free available, You just have to download its software, intall it on your system,
                        and start coding.</li>
                    <li>It has many in-built memory management functions malloc(), calloc(), and alloc() to utilize the
                        memory efficiently.</li>

                <p><b>Properties of C language</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple & efficient : The basic syntax style of implementing C language is very simple and easy
                        to learn.
                    </li>
                    <li>Fast :
                        statically typed programming language are faster than dynamic ones.
                    </li>
                    <li>Dynamic Memory Management :
                        One of the most significant features of C language is its support for dynamic memory
                        management (DMA).
                    </li>
                    <li>Function rich libraries :
                        C comes with an extensive set of libraries with several builtin functions that make the life
                        of a programmer easy.

        <h2>Elements of C</h2>
        <p>Every language has some basic elements and grammatical rules. Before programming in C, it is must to know the
            basic elements of the language. These basic elements are character set, variables, datatypes, constants,
            keywords, variable declaration, expressions, statements etc. All of these are used to construct a C program.
