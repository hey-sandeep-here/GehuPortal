        <h1>Internet</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Internet is a global network of billions of computers and other electronic devices. With the internet,
                it's possible to access almost any information, communicate with anyone else in the world, and do much
                more.</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="t1" class="wh">
            <h2>History of internet</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The origins of the internet are rooted in the USA of the 1950s.</li>
                <li>The cold war was at its height and huge tensions existed between North America and the Soviet Union.
                </li>
                <li>The US realised it needed a communications system that could not be affected by a Soviet nuclear attack</li>
                <li>At this time, computers were large, expensive machines exclusively used by military scientists and university staff.</li>
                <li>These machines were powerful but limited in numbers, and researchers grew increasingly frustrated: they required access to the technology, but had to travel great distances to use it.</li>
                <li>To solve this problem, researchers started ‘time-sharing’. This meant that users could simultaneously access a mainframe computer through a series of terminals, although individually they had only a fraction of the computer’s actual power at their command.</li>
                <li>The difficulty of using such systems led various scientists, engineers and organisations to research the possibility of a large-scale computer network.</li>
                <li>Invention of Internet &rarr; When networking technology was first developed, a number of scientists and engineers brought their research together to create the ARPANET. Later, other inventors’ creations paved the way for the web as we know it today.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="t2" class="wh">
            <h2>DNS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is the internet's equivalent of a phone book, and converts
                    hard-to-remember IP addresses into simple names.</li>
                <li>In the early 1980s, cheaper technology and the apprearance of desktop computers allowed the rapid
                    development of local area Networks (LANs). An increase in the amount of computers on the network
                    made it difficult to keep track of all the different IP addresses.</li>
                <li>This problem was solved by the introduction of Domain Name System (DNS) in 1983. DNS was invented by
                    Paul Mockapetris and Jon Postrel at the university of Southern California. It was one of the
                    innovations that paved the way for the world Wide Web.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>People use email for sharing infromation data files, photos, videos, business communications and
                        more. This has enabled faster communication between people and improved business efficiency. An
                        email has reduced paper usage and the load of physical mail systems.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>FTP is the file transfer protocol that enables data exchanges between two stakeholders over

                    <li>The data exchange may occur between two business entities or customers with business and vice
                        versa. </li>
                    <li>Usually, email restricts the size of a file that can be shared, and it is not secure to share
                        sensitive and confidential data accross public Networks. FTP concept is still is use in mobile
                        apps for file downloading.</li>

                    <li>It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding data

                        connection.</li>
                    <li>There are several types of routers, but most routers pass data between LANs (local area
                        networks) and WANs (wide area networks). A LAN is a group of connected devices restricted to a

                        transmitted on all ports 2 to 8.</li>
                    <li>Hub works like an electric wire, it receives data signals from one device and forwards them to
                        all other ports, except the source port.</li>
                    <li>It does not have any capability to identify any frames to know where it should forward because
                        it does not maintain any kind of table like switch. So there is a lot of traffic on the network
                        and network performance is also very poor, only one device transmits information at a particular

                    <li>TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. The term is used to describe a
                        set of protocols that govern how data moves through a network.</li>
                    <li>After the creation of ARPANET, more networks of computers began to join the network, and the need
                        arose for an agreed set of rules for handling data.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The world wide web - usually called the web for short - is a collection of different websites you
                    can access through the internet. A website is made up of related text, images, and other resources.

                <li>The terms 'World Wide Web' and 'internet' are often confused. The internet is the networking
                    infrastructure that connects devices together, while the World Wide Web is a way of accessing
                    information through the medium of the internet.</li>
                <li>Tim Berners-Lee first proposed the idea of a 'web of information' in 1989. It relied on 'hyperlinks'
                    to connect documents together. Written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), a hyperlink can point to
                    any other HTML page or file that sits on top of internet.</li>
                <li>Berners-Lee also created a piece of software that could present HTML documents in an easy-to-read
                    format. He called this ‘browser’ the ‘WorldWideWeb’.</li>

                <li>An electronic communication invented in the 1970s to do communication faster during the era of letters and telegrams that changed the way people communicate with each other is called an Email.</li>
                <li>Ray Tomlinson is called as the father of the email system, and he sent a communication between two computer systems for ARPANET.</li>
                <li>Email is called so since it is an electronic mail sent to a person or to a system, and unlike the normal mail, the physical letter or paper is not needed for the same. Instead of a postal service and an address, an email address and an internet connection are needed.</li>
