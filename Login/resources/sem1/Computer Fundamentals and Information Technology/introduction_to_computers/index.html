        <h1>Components of Computers</h1>
        <p>There are five basic components of the computer that help make this processing of data easier and more convenient.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Input Unit</li>
            <li>Output Unit</li>
            <li>Memory Unit</li>
            <li>Control Unit</li>
            <li>Arithmetical and Logical Unit</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="../../images/blockCom.svg" alt="" class="wb">
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Input Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A computer will only respond when a command is given to the device.</li>
                <li>These commands can be given using the input unit or the input devices.</li>
                <li>For example, using a keyboard, we can type things on a notepad, and the computer processes the entered data and then displays the output of the same on the screen.</li>
                <li>The data entered can be in the form of numbers, alphabet, images, etc.</li>
                <li>We enter the information using an input device, the processing units convert it into computer
                    understandable languages and then the final output is received by a human-understandable language.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Output Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When we command a computer to perform a task, it reverts for the action performed and gives us a
                    result. This results is called output.</li>
                <li>There are various output devices connected to the computer.</li>
                <li>The most basic of which is a monitor.</li>
                <li>Whatever we write using keyboard or click using a mouse, is all displayed on the monitor.</li>
                <li>Thus, the output unit gives us the final result once the entire processing is done within the
                    mechanism of a device.</li>
                <li>For example: when we visit an ATM, we enter our details like language, pin, amount to be withdrawn,
                    etc. And then the final money which the cash dispenser releases is our outcome. In this case, the
                    cash dispenser acts as an output unit.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Memory Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When we enter the data into the computer using an input device, the entered information immediately
                    gets saved in the memory unit of the CPU.</li>
                <li>Because of the presence of some existing programming, the MU transmits the data further to the other
                    parts of the CPU.</li>
                <li>Similarly, when the output of our command is processed by the computer, it is saved in the memory
                    unit before giving the output to the user.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Control Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>This is the core unit which manages the entire functioning of the computer device.</li>
                <li>It is one of the most essential components of the computer system.</li>
                <li>The Control Unit collects the data entered using the input unit, leads it on for processing and once
                    that is done, receives the output and presents it to the user.</li>
                <li>It can be said to the centre of all processing actions taking place inside a computer device.</li>
                <li>Basically, the instructions taken, interpretation of entered data, issuing signals to execute the
                    data and then finally retrieving the data is all done in the control unit.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Arithmetic & Logical Unit</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>As the name suggests, all the mathematical calculations or arithmetic operations are performed in
                    the Arithmetic and Logical Unit of the CPU.</li>
                <li>It can perform actions like a comparision of data and decision-making actions.</li>
                <li>ALU comprises circuits using which addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and other
                    numerical based calculations can be performed.</li>

            <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The CPU is the core of any computer devices. It comprises three major components of the computer
                    which have been discussed above :
                    <ul>
                        <li>Memory Unit</li>

                <li> Another feature was the core storage.</li>
                <li> A transistor may be a device composed of semiconductor material that amplifies a sign or opens or
                    closes a circuit.</li>
                <li>Transistors were invented in Bell Labs.</li>
                <li> The use of transistors made it possible to perform powerfully and with due speed.</li>
                <li> It reduced the dimensions and price and thankfully the warmth too, which was generated by vacuum
                    tubes.</li>
                <li> Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, programming language and input, and output units also came
                    into the force within the second generation.</li>
                <li>Programming language was shifted from high level to programming language and made programming
                    comparatively a simple task for programmers. </li>
                <li>Languages used for programming during this era were FORTRAN (1956), ALGOL (1958), and COBOL (1959).

                <li> The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, located all the components of the pc from the central
                    processing unit and memory to input/ output controls on one chip and allowed the dimensions to

                            <li>After the current instruction's execution is completed, these registers are used to
                                calculate the address of the next instructions.</li>
                            <li>Let's discuss some process unit registers used in computer hardware in detail:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Accumulator (AC):

                                            <li>This is general-purpose processing register frequently used to store
                                                data taken from the memory.</li>
                                            <li>It varies in numbers according to different microprocessors.</li>
                                            <li>This register consists of 16 bits.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Address Register (AR)

                                            <li>This register consists of 12 bits and is used to store the memory's
                                                address.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                            <li>This is ued to keep track of the execution of a program.</li>
                                            <li>These registers consits of the memory address of the next instruction to
                                                be fetched.</li>
                                            <li>It points to the next instruction's address to be fetched from the main
                                                memory when the previous instruction is executed.</li>
                                            <li>It also counts the number of instructions.</li>
                                            <li>The incrementation of the program counter depends on the type of
                                                architecture: For a 32-bit architecture, the counter gets incremented by
                                                four every time to fectch the instructions.</li>

                    <li>ALU is a main component of the CPU that performs arithmetic and logic operations.</li>
                    <li>An ALU is also known as an integer unit, an integrated circuit within a CPU.</li>
                    <li>It is the last component to perform calculations in the processor.</li>
                    <li>It can perform all processes related to arithmetic and logic operations, including additon,
                        subraction, shifting operations, and boolean comparisions (OR, AND and Not).</li>
                    <li>It is further split into arithmetic units (AU) and logic units (LU).</li>
                    <li>The operands and code used by the ALU help in predicting the operations that need to be
                        performed according to the input data.</li>
                    <li>It sends the information to the memory after processing.</li>

                <div class="wh">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Besides addition and subtraction, ALU also handles the multiplication of two integers whose
                            result is an integer.</li>
                        <li>However, division operations may not be performed by ALUs as division operations may produce
                            floating-point numbers.</li>
                        <li>Instead, the floating-point unit (FPU) usually handles the non-integer calculations.</li>
                        <li>Additionally, we can design an ALU to perform any operation.</li>
                        <li>However, it becomes constly as the operations become complex as ALU takes up more space in
                            the CPU.</li>

                        <li>More power means more heat and energy consumption: hence, it must be a moderation between
                            complex and powerful ALU to adjuct the cost and speed.</li>
