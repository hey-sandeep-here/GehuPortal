            <h2>Virtual function</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A virtual function is a member function in a base class that can be overridden by a derived class to
                    provide a different implementation. It allows the derived class to define its own version of the
                    function, providing flexibility and extensibility in the object-oriented hierarchy.</li>
                <li>The virtual keyword is used to declare a function as virtual in the base class.</li>
                <li>Virtual functions enable dynamic polymorphism, which means that a function call is resolved
                    dynamically at runtime based on the actual object type rather than the declared type. This allows
                    objects of different derived classes to be treated uniformly through a base class pointer or
                    reference, simplifying code and improving flexibility.</li>
                <li>When a virtual function is called through a base class pointer or reference, the function that is
                    invoked is determined at runtime based on the type of the actual object being pointed to or
                    referenced. This is known as dynamic or late binding.</li>
                <li>Virtual functions are typically used in scenarios where different derived classes need to provide
                    their own implementation of a specific behavior defined in the base class. The base class provides a
                    common interface through virtual functions, while the derived classes override these functions to
                    customize their behavior.</li>
                <li>It is important to note that virtual functions should be declared in the base class and overridden
                    in the derived classes using the override keyword to ensure proper overriding and to indicate the
                    intention of overriding the base class function.</li>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Runtime polymorphism</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Runtime polymorphism, also known as dynamic polymorphism, is achieved through the use of virtual
                        functions.</li>
                    <li>It allows the selection of the appropriate function implementation at runtime based on the
                        actual object type. This is possible because virtual functions are resolved dynamically (late
                        binding).</li>
                    <li>The binding of the function call to its implementation occurs at runtime, depending on the type
                        of the object being referenced or pointed to.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Compile-time Polymorphism</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compile-time polymorphism, also known as static polymorphism, is achieved through function
                        overloading and templates. In function overloading, multiple functions with the same name but
                        different parameter lists can be defined. The appropriate function is selected based on the
                        static types of the arguments at compile time.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>So, late binding is associated with runtime polymorphism, where the appropriate function
                    implementation is determined at runtime based on the actual object type. Early binding is associated
                    with compile-time polymorphism, where the function call is resolved at compile time based on the
                    static types of the objects involved.</li>
