                <ul>
                    <li>Traditionally, health has been viewed as an "absence of disease" and if one is free from
                        disease, then the person is considered healthy. This concept is known as the "biomedical

                <p><b>Ciriticsm of biomedical concept:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>According to biomedical concept, one factor i.e. gern is responsible for illness, but other
                        factors which contirbute to the illness are not considered.</li>
                    <li>But it has been seen that some of the health problems such as accidents, nutritional deficiency
                        disorders, mental disorders, disease due to environment pollution also occur. Even germs also
                        get an opportunity to multiply and thereby cause disease, it get appropriate environment inside
                        the body to grow.</li>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Ecological concept:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ecologist put form an attractive hypothesis which viewed health as a dynamic equilibrium
                        between man and his environment.</li>
                    <li>The ecological cocept raises two issues:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Imperfect man</li>
                            <li>Imperfect environment</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>So in the view of ecologists health problems occur due to environment pollution or mans
                        maladjustment or imperfect man environment.</li>

                        health.</li>
                    <li>The holistic approach implies that all sectors of society have an effect on health in
