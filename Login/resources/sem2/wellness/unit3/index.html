        <h1>Health & Environment</h1>
        <p>The environment refers to the surrounding conditions in which humans live and interact. It can include both
            physical and biological elements that can influence individual and community health. Here are some notes on
            the different aspects of environmental health and hygiene:
        <ol>
            <li>Physical environment: The physical environment refers to the surroundings in which individuals live and
                work. This includes factors such as air quality, temperature, lighting, noise, and sanitation. Poor
                physical environmental conditions can lead to health problems such as respiratory illnesses, eye and
                skin diseases, and heatstroke.</li>
            <li>Biological environment: The biological environment refers to the germs, bacteria, and other organisms
                that live in the physical environment. Biological hazards such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi can cause
                infections, allergies, and other illnesses.</li>
            <li>Psycho-social environment: The psycho-social environment refers to the emotional and social conditions
                in which individuals live and interact. This includes factors such as stress, social support, and social
                connectedness. The psycho-social environment can influence an individual's mental and emotional health
                and well-being.</li>
            <li>Living conditions and health: Poor living conditions, such as inadequate housing, poor sanitation, and
                lack of access to clean water, can lead to health problems such as tuberculosis, malaria, measles, and
                cholera.</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Environmental health and hygiene is important to promote good health and prevent illnesses. For example,
            practicing good hygiene such as hand washing, wearing masks, and proper waste disposal can help prevent the
            spread of infectious diseases. Additionally, maintaining clean and sanitized surfaces can help prevent
            allergies and asthma.</p>
        <p>In summary, the environment plays a significant role in individual and community health. Ensuring appropriate
            physical, biological, psycho-social, and living conditions is essential for promoting good health and
            preventing illnesses. As healthcare providers and practitioners, it is crucial to consider the environmental
            factors that influence individual and community health and provide appropriate interventions and
            recommendations to address these factors.</p>
