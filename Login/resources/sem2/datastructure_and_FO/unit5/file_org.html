            <ul>
                <li><b>Record:</b> (Group/Segment) it is a collection of information items about a particular entity.
                    E.g. A collection of information about a student in a college.</li>
                <li><b>Field/Item:</b> AN item of a record is a unit of meaningful information about an entity. E.g.
                    Name, Id no, Address of student.</li>
                <li><b>File:</b> A collection of records involving a set of entities with certain aspects in common and
                    organized for some particular purpose is called file. E.g. Collection of all students' record make a
                    file.</li>
                <li><b>Key:</b> A record item or field which uniquely identifies a record in a file is called a key.
                    E.g. Id_no of a student for student record.</li>
                <li><b>Database:</b> If the set of files is used by the application program for some particular
                    application area and if these files exhibit certain associations or relationships between the
                    records of the files then such a collection of files is called as database. E.g. student data base
                    which has files/tables like student information, result, attendence, registration, placement etc. In
                    which all these different data have relationship and association between them.</li>
                <li><b>Transaction:</b> A particular operation involving a record or set of records is called as
                    transaction. E.g. "Delete all students of batch = 00".</li>
                <li>Fields, records, files and databases are logical terms.</li>
                <li><b>Block/Physical record:</b> Several logical records can be groped together to form a single
                    physical entity to be stored on physical device is called as block or physical record.</li>
                <li><b>Serial-access device:</b> The devices on which data is stored serially and can be retrieved only
                    serially and access time of any data is proportional to the location of the data on device, are
                    called as serial device. These device are cheap compared to direct access devices. E.g. Magnetic
                    tape.</li>
                <li><b>Direct-access Device: </b> Direct access devices, also known as random access devices, are
                    storage devices that allow data to be accessed directly, regardless of its physical location in
                    memory. This means that the access time for retrieving any record from the device is constant and
                    does not depend on the sequential order of the data. These devices are costly. E.g. Magnetic disk,
                    hard disk drives, solid-state drives (SSDs).</li>

            <li><b>File organization:</b> The technique used to represent and store the records on a file is called as
                file organization.</li>
            <li>The 4 fundamental file organization are:
                <ol>
                    <li>Sequential</li>
                    <li>Direct/Random</li>
                    <li>Index sequential</li>

            <h2>Sequential file organization</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In sequential file organization, data is stored in a sequential manner, one record after another,
                    based on the order of insertion. Records are accessed sequentially, starting from the beginning of
                    the file. Sequential access is efficient, but random access or modifications to specific records can
                    be time-consuming.</li>

            <h2>Random/Direct File organization</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When records in a file are arranged in such a way so that the individual records can be directly
                    accessed whenever they are needed is called as direct File organization.</li>
                <li>In this file organization there exists a direct relationship between a key used to identify the
                    particular record and the location of the record in a file.</li>
                <li>The records do not necessarily appear physically in sorted order by their key values as in
                    sequential files.</li>
                <li>When relative file is created the relationship that will be used to translate between key values and
                    physical address of record in file is assigned. That relationship is called as mapping function R.
                </li>
                <li>Direct files are typically used when only selected records need to be accessed from a file, rather
                    than retrieving all records simultaneously, such as in interactive processing scenarios. For
                    instance, in an online banking system, a user may only wish to access their own account.</li>

            <h2>Index Sequential file organization</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>An effective way to organize a collection of records when there is a need of both accesses. To
                    access the records sequentially by some key value and also to access the records individually by
                    some key is called as index sequential file organization.</li>
                <li>It supports combination of access types that are supported by a sequential file and a relative file.
                </li>
                <li>It is used when there is a need for both batch and interactive processing. E.g. Student management
                    system in which we have to calculate result for every student as well as we have requirement like of
                    address to send a letter to only that student who is detained. So the file can be stored
                    sequentially based on student id. And index table is also provided with key as student id which
                    directly maps student id to its record.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Advantages</h3>
                <ol>

            <h2>Multi key file organization</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When a file records are made accessed based on more than one key are called Multikey file
                    organization. </li>
                <li>This file organization is needed many times. E.g. In banking system we keep records of accounts in
                    file. Now account holder needs account information which can be access through account, while load
                    officer needs account records with a given value of overdue limit. So we need to provide to access
                    path to the record based on different need. Generally these files are index sequential file in which
                    file is stored sequentially based on primary key and more than one index table are provided based on
                    different keys. Basically there are 2 approaches for implementing multikey file organization.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Inverted file organization</li>
                        <li>Multi list file organization</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>1. Inverted file organization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In this file organization a key's inversion index contain all of the values that the key
                        presently has in the records of the data file. Each key-value entry in the inversion index
                        points to all the data records that have the corresponding value. The data file is said to be
                        inverted on that key.</li>
                    <li>Inverted files are sorted on inversion index so that binary search can be applied to find out
                        index or record. Whenever record is added in data file its corresponding entry has to be made in
                        inverted file.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>2. Multi list file organization</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In multi list file organization the index contain all values that the secondary key has in data
                        file same as inverted file but the difference is that the entry in the multi index for a
                        seconday key is pointer to the first data record with thay key value. That record contains
                        pointer to second record having same key. Thus there is a linked of data records for each value
                        of secondary key. Multi list chains are usually bidirectional and occasionally are circular to
                        improve update operation.</li>
