        <h1>File handling</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The input and output operations that we have performed so far were done through screen and keyboard
                only. After termination of program, all the entered data is lost because primary memory is volatile.
                When the data has to be used later, then it becomes necessary to keep it in permanent storage device. C
                supports the concept of files through which data can be stored on the disk or secondary storage device.
                The stored data can be read whenever required. A file is a collection of related data placed on the
                disk.</li>
            <li>The file handling in C can be broadly categorized in two types:
                <ul>
                    <li>High level (standard files or stream oriented files)</li>
                    <li>Low level (system oriented files)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>High level file handling is managed by library functions while low level file handling is managed by
                system calls. The high level file handling is commonly used since it is easier to manage and hides most
                of
                the details from the programmer.</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="t2" class="wh">
            <h2>Text and Binary modes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>There are two ways of storing data in files, binary format and text format.</li>
                <li>In text format, data is stored as lines of characters with each line terminated by a newline
                    character('\n').</li>
                <li>In binary format, data stored on the disk in the same way as it is represented in the computer
                    memory. Unix system do not make any distinction between text file and binary files.</li>
                <li>Text files are in human readable form and they can be created and read using any text editor, while
                    binary files are not in human readable form and they can be created and read only by specific
                    program written for them. The binary data stored in the file can't be read using a text editor.</li>
                <li>The integer 1679 will take only 2 bytes in a binary file while it will occupy 4 bytes in a text file
                    because in-binary file it is stored as an integer. while in text file it is stored as a sequence of
                    4 characters i.e. '1', '6', '7', '9'.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="t3" class="wh">
            <h2>Concept of buffer</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Buffer is an area in memory where the data is temporarily stored before being written to the file.
                    When we open a file, a buffer is automatically associated with its file pointer. Whatever data we
                    send to the file is not immediately written to the file. First it is sent to the buffer and when the
                    buffer is full then its contents are written to the file. When the file is closed, all the contents
                    of buffer are automatically written to the file even if the buffer is not full. This is called
                    flushing the buffer, we can also explicitly flush the buffer by a function fflush().</li>
                <li>The concept of buffer is used to increase efficiency. If there had been no buffer we would have to
                    access the disk each time for writing even single byte of data. This would have taken lot of time
                    because each time the disk is accessed, the read/write head has to be repositioned. When buffering
                    is done, the data is collected in the buffer and data equal to the size of buffer is written to the
                    file at a time, so the number of times disk is accessed decreases, which improves efficiency.</li>
                <li>The steps for file operations in C programming are as follows-
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open a file</li>
                        <li>Read the file or write data in the file</li>
                        <li>Close the file</li>
                    </ol>
                    The functions fopen() and fclose() are used for opening and closing the files respectively.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="t4" class="wh">
            <h2>Opening a file</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A file must be opened before any I/O operations can be performed on that file. The process of
                    estalishing a connection between the program and file is called opening the file.</li>
                <li>A structure named <b>FILE</b> is defined in the file stdio.h that contains all information about the
                    file like name, status, buffer size, current position, end of file status etc. All these details are
                    hidden from the programmer and the operating system takes care of all these things.</li>
                <li>A file pointer is a pointer to a structure of type FILE. Whenever a file is opened, a structure of
                    type FILE is associated with it, and a file pointer that points to this structure identifies this
                    file. The function fopen() is used to open a file.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Declaration:</h3>
                <pre>

FILE *fopen("filename.txt", "opening mode");

                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li>fopen() function takes two strings as arguments, the first one is the name of the file to be
                        open and the second one is the mode that decides which operations (read, write, append etc) are
                        to performed on the file. On success, fopen() returns a pointer of type FILE and on error it
                        returns NULL. </li>
                    <li>The return value of fopen() is assigned to a FILE pointer declared previously. For example
                        &darr;</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>After opening the file with fopen(), the name of file is not used in the program for any
                        operation on it. Whenever we have to perform a operation on the file, we'll use the file pointer
                        returned by fopen() function. so the name of file sometimes known as external name, while the
                        file pointer associated with it is known as its internal name. </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"w" (write): If the file doesn't exist then this mode creates a new file for writing, and if
                            the file already exists then the previous data is erased and the new data entered is written
                            to the file.</li>
                        <li>"a" (append): If the file doesn't exist then this mode creates a new file, and if the file
                            already exists then the new data entered is appended at the end of existing data. In this
                            mode, the data existing in the file is not erased as in "w" mode.</li>
                        <li>"r" (read): This mode is used for opening an existing file for reading purpose only. The
                            file to be opened must exist and the previous data of file is not erased.</li>
                        <li>"w+" (write+read): This mode is same as "w" mode but in this mode we can also read and
                            modify the data. If the file doesn't exist then a new file is created and if the file exists
                            then previous data is erased.</li>
                        <li>"r+" (read+write): This mode is same as "r" mode but in this mode we can also write and
                            modify existing data. The file to be opened must exist and the previous data of file is not
                            erased. Since we can add new data modify existing data so this mode is also called update
                            mode.</li>
                        <li>"a+" (append+read): This mode is same as the "a" mode but in this mode we can also read the
                            data stored in the file. If the file doesn't exist, a new file is created and if the file
                            already exists then new data is appended at the end of existing data. We cannot modify
                            existing data in this mode.</li>
                        <li>To open a file in binary mode we can append 'b' to the mode, and to open the file in text
                            mode 't' can be appended to the mode. But since text mode is the default mode, 't' is
                            generally omitted while opening file in text mode. For example:
                            <ul>
                                <li>"wb" &rarr; Binary file opened in write mode</li>
                                <li>"ab+" or "a+b" &rarr; Binary file opened in append mode</li>
                                <li>"rt+" or "r+t" &rarr; Text file opened in update mode</li>
                                <li>"w" &rarr; Text file open in write mode</li>
                            </ul>

                            <li>If we try to open a file in read or update mode, and the file doesn't exist or we do not
                                have read permission on that file.</li>
                            <li>If we try to create a file but there is no space on the disk or we don't have write
                                permission.</li>
                            <li>If we try to create file that already exists and we don't have have permission to delete
                                that file.</li>
                            <li>Operating system limits the number of files that can be opened at a time and we are
                                trying to open more files than that number.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>We can give full pathname to open a file. Suppose we want to open a file in DOS whose path is
                        "E:\booksdir\names.dat, then we'll have to write as-
                        <br>fp = fopn("E:\\booksdir\\names.dat", "r");
                        <br>Here we have used double backslash because single backslash inside string is considered as
                        an escape character, '\b' and '\n' will be regarded as escape sequences if we use single
                        backslash. In Unix, a single forward slash can be used.
                    </li>
                    <li>Never give the mode in single quotes, since it is a string not a character constant.

                <li>On closing the file, all the buffers associated with it are flushed i.e. all the data that is in the

                    file is closed so that these buffers can be available for other files. </li>
                <li>Although all the files are closed automatically when the program terminates normally, but sometimes
                    it may be necessary to close the file by fclose() e.g. when we have to reopen the file in some open
                    mode or when we exceed the number of opened files permitted by the system. Moreover it is a good
                    practise to close file explicitly by fclose() when no more operations are to be performed on that
                    file because it becomes clear to the reader of the program that the file has no use now.</li>

                    has been taken out of the drive.</li>

            <h2>Formatted and Unformatted I/O function</h2>
            <p>In C programming, input/output (I/O) functions are categorized into two types: formatted and unformatted
                file handling functions. These functions serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics.
                Here's an explanation of each type:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Formatted I/O functions</b>:
                    <br>Formatted I/O functions deal with data in a human-readable format. They allow you to read data
                    from or write data to files using a specified format. These functions provide more control over the
                    data's representation and formatting. Some commonly used formatted I/O functions in C include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>printf(): Used to format and print data to the standard output (usually the console) or a
                            file.</li>
                        <LI>scanf(): Used to read and parse formatted data from the standard input (usually the
                            keyboard) or a file.</LI>
                        <li>fprintf(): Similar to printf(), but writes the formatted data to a specified file instead of
                            the standard output.</li>
                        <li>fscanf(): Similar to scanf(), but reads formatted data from a specified file instead of the
                            standard input.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Formatted I/O functions use format specifiers (such as %d, %f, %s, etc.) to specify the data type
                    and formatting options for input or output. These functions provide flexibility in how data is
                    displayed or interpreted.
                </li>
                <li><b>Unformatted I/O Functions</b>:
                    <br>Unformatted I/O functions deal with data in its raw binary format. They read or write data
                    directly as a sequence of bytes without any specific formatting. These functions are commonly used
                    for binary file handling, where data is read or written without any special formatting
                    considerations. Some commonly used unformatted I/O functions in C include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>fread(): Reads a specified number of bytes directly from a file.</li>
                        <li>fwrite(): Writes a specified number of bytes directly to a file.</li>
                        <li>getc(), fgetc(): Reads a single character (byte) from a file.</li>
                        <li>putc(), fputc(): Writes a single character (byte) to a file.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Unformatted I/O functions are useful when working with binary data, such as image files, sound
                    files, or structured data stored in binary format. They provide a straightforward way to read and
                    write raw data without any specific formatting requirements.
                </li>
            </ol>
            It's important to choose the appropriate type of I/O functions based on your requirements and the nature of
            the data you are dealing with. Formatted I/O functions provide more control over formatting and are suitable
            for human-readable data, while unformatted I/O functions work with raw binary data.

    <ul>
        <li>Till now, we have done file handling using function calls, but now we will do using system calls</li>
        <li>But why?
            <ul>
                <li>The use of system calls, such as open(), close(), read(), etc., offers some key differences compared
                    to higher-level functions like fopen(), fclose(), fread(), etc. Here are the differences between
                    using system calls and higher-level functions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Level of abstraction:
                            <br>System calls provide a lower-level interface to the operating system, allowing direct
                            interaction with the underlying functionality. They offer finer-grained control and access
                            to system resources. In contrast, higher-level functions, such as those provided by the C
                            standard library, abstract away many low-level details and provide a more user-friendly
                            interface. They handle certain operations and error checking internally, simplifying the
                            code for common file operations.
                        </li>
                        <li>Protability:
                            <br>System calls can be platform-specific since they directly interact with the underlying
                            operating system. On the other hand, higher-level functions are often implemented in a
                            portable manner across different platforms. The C standard library functions provide a
                            consistent interface regardless of the underlying operating system, making it easier to
                            write cross-platform code.
                        </li>
                        <li>Flexitybility and control:
                            <br>System calls offer more flexibility and control over file operations. They allow you to
                            use various flags and options to fine-tune the behavior of file operations, such as opening
                            modes, file permissions, and file positioning. System calls also enable advanced operations
                            like asynchronous I/O, file locking, and handling special file types. Higher-level functions
                            may not provide all of these capabilities or expose them directly.
                        </li>
                        <li>Performance:
                            <br>System calls generally have lower overhead compared to higher-level functions. This is
                            because higher-level functions often involve additional layers of abstraction and may
                            perform additional checks and operations. System calls directly interact with the operating
                            system kernel, bypassing some of these overheads. However, the performance difference might
                            be negligible for many applications unless low-level optimizations are required.

            <li>For example, providing access to input and output devices such as monitors and keywords. We can use

                    <li>The file descriptor is an integer that uniquely itentifies an open file of the process.</li>
                    <li>In operating systems, a file descriptor is an abstract representation of an opened file or I/O
                        stream. It is a non-negative integer that uniquely identifies an open file within a process.
                        File descriptors are used to perform various operations on files, such as reading, writing, and
                        closing.</li>
                    <li>When you open a file using 'open()' system call library function, a file descriptor is
                        returned. You can think of it as a handle or reference to the opened file. This file descriptor
                        is then used in subsequent system or library calls to perform operations on the file.</li>

                <li>buf: buffer to read data from</li>
                <li>cnt: length of the buffer</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Return value</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>returns number of bytes read on success</li>
                <li>returns - on reaching the end of the file</li>
                <li>return -1 on error</li>
                <li>returns -1 on signal interrupt</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Important points</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>buf</b> needs to point to a valid memory locaton with a length not smaller than the specified
                    size because of overflow.</li>
                <li><b>fd</b> should be a valid file descriptor if fd is NULL then the read should generate an error.
                </li>
                <li><b>cnt</b> is the requested number of bytes read, while the return value is the actual number of
                    bytes read. Also, some times read system call should read fewer bytes than cnt.</li>
            </ul>
