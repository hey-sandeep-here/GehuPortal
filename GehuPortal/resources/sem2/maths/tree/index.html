                    have degree 1 or 3.</li>
                <li>A full binary tree will always have odd number of vertices say n.
                    <br>Proof:
                    <br>Since there is exactly one vertex (root) of even degree & the remaining (n-1) vertices are of
                    odd degree, but the number of vertices of odd degree in a graph is always even therefore n-1 is
                    even, hence n is odd.
