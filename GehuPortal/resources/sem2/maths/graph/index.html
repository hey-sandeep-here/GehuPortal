                <li>Graph theory was originated by this problem.</li>
                <li>Konigsberg was a city in Russia, and this problem happen in Pregel river.</li>
                <li>The problem involves determining whether it is possible to walk through the city, crossing each of
                    the seven bridges exactly once and returning to the starting point.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/bridge.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>If we start from any regional part, & we have to cover one bridge only once so that every bridge
                    should be crossed as well as all regional part should also be covered.</li>
                <li>Euler was the mathematician that worked on it.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/bridge2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>If every region will have even number of bridges then only bridges can be crossed once.
                </li>
                <li>Degree of a vertex = number of edges connected to a vertex.</li>
                <li>deg (1) = 3, deg (2) = 3, deg (3) = 5, deg (4) = 3</li>
                <li>As every vertex have odd degree that's why we can't cross all bridges at once.</li>
                <li>Main conclusion: In order to return to the starting vertex after visiting every vertex, it is
                    necessary for every vertex to have an even degree.
                    <br> Therefore, it is not feasible to traverse each bridge exactly once while covering all bridges
                    and regions.

                <li>A graph G(V, E) is called Bi-partite if its vertex set V(G) can be partitioned into two non-empty
                    disjoint subsets v1(G) and v2(G) in a such a way that each edge e &isin; E(G) has its one end point
                    in v1(G) and other end point in v2(G), the partition V = v1 &Union; v2 called bi-partition of G.

            <h2>Handshaking theorem</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The sum of the degrees of all vertices of a graph G is twice the number of edges in G.

            </ul>
            <p>Proof &rarr; Consider a graph G(V, E) with m edges and n vertices i.e.,
                <br>V = {v1, v2, v3, ..., vn}
                <br>E = {e1, e2, e3, ..., em}
                <br>Since degree of vertex is defined as the number of edge connected with it. And every edge is
                connected with exactly two vertices so each edge is counted twice at each of its end. This implies that
                the sum of the degrees of all vertices in G is twice the number of edges in G.
