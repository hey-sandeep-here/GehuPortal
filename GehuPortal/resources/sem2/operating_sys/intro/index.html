            <h2>Introduction to Operating System and its Functions </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Operating system is a system software which works as a interface between user and hardware.</li>
                <li>User cannot directly access hardware this is where Operating System helps user to access the
                    hardware.</li>
                <li>Why there is need of operating system?
                    <ul>
                        <li>If there is no operating system and user want to access a particular hardware, he have to
                            write a program for it. Without OS interacting with hardware, it will become complex.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Major goal of OS is to provide convenience to the user.</li>
                <li>Throughput: number of tasks executed per unit time.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linux operating system provides throughput</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <h3>Major functionality of OS.</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Resource manager: When there are multiple user in a system then OS manages the resource like
                        governing how much hardware to be provided to which user, so that system is not loaded.</li>
                    <li>Process management: OS manages how to execute all the multiple process running at same time.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Here we use various CPU scheduling.</li>
                            <li>in this OS decides which process gets time. This function is called
                                <b>process
                                    scheduling</b>. An operating system does the following activities for process
                                management:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Keeps track of <b>processor and states of process</b>. The program responsible
                                        for this
                                        task is known as <b>traffic controller.</b></li>
                                    <li>Allocates the processor (CPU) to a process.</li>
                                    <li>De-allocates processor when a process in no longer required.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>


                    </li>
                    <li>Storage management (HD): Basically includes secondary devices. It manages how to store permanent
                        data in memory.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Storage management is done by "file mangement".</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Memory management (RAM): managing how much memory of RAM to allocate or deallocate to different
                        process as RAM is limited.
                        <ul>
                            <li>It refers to management of primary memory.</li>
                            <li>Main memory is a large array of bytes where each byte has its own address.</li>
                            <li>Main memory provides a fast storage that can be accessed directly by the CPU. For a
                                program
                                to be executed, it must be in the main memory.</li>
                            <li>Operating system keeps track of primary memory, i.e. what part of it are in use by whom,
                                what
                                part are not in use.</li>
                            <li>In multiprogramming, the OS decides which process will get memory when and how much.
                            </li>
                            <li>Allocates the memory when a process requests it to do so.</li>
                            <li>De-allocates the memory when a process no longer needs it or has been terminated.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Device management: an operating system manages device communication via their respective
                        <b>device
                            drivers</b>.

                        <ul>
                            <li>OS does the following things:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Keep tracks of all devices. The program responsible for this task is known as
                                        the <b>I/O
                                            controller. </b></li>
                                    <li>Allocates the device in the most efficient way.</li>
                                    <li>De-allocates devices.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>File management: a file system is normally organized into <b>directories</b> for easy navigation
                        and
                        usage. These directories may contain files and other directories.
                        <ul>
                            <li>O/S does &darr;
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Keeps track of information, location, user, status, etc. The collective
                                        facilities often
                                        known as <b>file system.</b></li>
                                    <li>Decides who gets the resources.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Security and privacy: practising authentication
                        <ul>
                            <li>By means of password and similar other techniques, it prevents unauthorized access to
                                programs and data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Control over system performance: records the delay between a request for a service and response
                        from the system.</li>
                    <li>Job accounting: keeps track of time and resources used by various jobs and users.</li>
                    <li>Error detection aids: production of dumps, traces, error messages and other debugging and error
                        detecting aids.</li>
                    <li>Co-ordination between other software and users: it involves managing the integration and
                        utilization of compilers, interpreters, assemblers, and other software applications among the
                        various users of computer systems.</li>

                <h3>Properties or characteristics of OS:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reliability: reliability is that a system does exactly what it is designed to do.
                        <ul>
                            <li>At software level OS must be more reliable on detecting virus or malicious code as they
                                take
                                control of the system for their own purposes by exploiting design or implementation
                                errors
                                in the operating system's defenses.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Availability: it is the percentage of time that the system is usable. Some system crashes
                        frequently, losing the user's work. Both reliability & availability are desirable.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Availability is affected by two factors: the frequencry of failure called the <b>mean
                                    time
                                    to failure (MTTF)</b> and the time it takes to restore a system to a working state
                                after
                                failure (for example, to reboot), the MTTR (mean time to repair).</li>
                            <li>Availability can be improved by increasing the MTTF or reducing the MTTR.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Ease of management: OS must be easy to manage as there are lots of help & tutorials are
                        available to
                        rectify the erros.</li>
                    <li>Security: as OS has administrative user that can make changes to the computer but for other user
                        to
                        make changes he has to enter the password of administration.</li>
                    <li>Associated utilities: OS must have lots of associated utilities available like windows OS has
                        lots
                        of version and according to their version lots of free utilities are available like <b>MS Office
                            +
                            MS SQL + Developing Languages</b>.</li>
                    <li>Cost: OS cost should be accordance of its features like windows has around $100 where DOS is
                        free of
                        charge as so is LINUX.</li>
                    <li>Support for the users: OS should have a help section for users if any error or problem occurs,
                        like
                        Windows has a proper help section and websites, whereas Linux has books in pdf format available
                        and
                        DOS has websites and a forum for help as DOS is not very popular.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>When the first electronic computer was developed in 1940, it was created without any
                        operating system.</li>
                    <li>In early times, users have full access to the computer machine and write a program for each
                        task in absolute machine language.</li>
                    <li>The programmer can perform and solve only simple mathematical calculations during the
                        computer generation, and this calculation does not require an operating system.</li>

            <div class="in">
                <p>The Second Generation (1955 - 1965)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first operating system (OS) was created in the early 1950s and was known as GMOS.
                        General
                        Motors has developed OS for the IBM computer.</li>
                    <li>The second-generation operating system was based on a single stream batch processing system
                        because it collects all similar jobs in groups or batches and then submits the jobs to the
                        operating system using a punch card to complete all jobs in a machine.</li>
                    <li>At each completion of jobs (either normally or abnormally), control transfer to the
                        operating system that is cleaned after completing one job and then continues to read and
                        initiates the next job in a punch card. After that, new machines were called mainframes,
                        which were very big and used by professional operators.</li>

                        operating system that could simultaneously perform multiple tasks in a single computer
                        program called multiprogramming. </li>
                    <li>The introduction of multiprogramming plays a very important role in developing operating
                        systems that allow a CPU to be busy every time by performing different tasks on a computer
                        at the same time. </li>
                    <li>During the third generation, there was a new development of minicomputer's phenomenal growth
                        starting in 1961 with the DEC PDP-1. These PDP's leads to the creation of personal computers
                        in the fourth generation</li>

                <p>The Fourth Generation (1980 - Present Day)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The fourth generation of operating systems is related to the development of the personal
                        computer. However, the personal computer is very similar to the minicomputers that were
                        developed in the
                        third generation. The cost of a personal computer was very high at that time; there were
                        small fractions of minicomputers costs.</li>
                    <li>A major factor related to creating personal computers was the birth of Microsoft and the
                        Windows operating system. Microsoft created the first window operating system in 1975. After
                        introducing the Microsoft Windows OS, Bill Gates and Paul Allen had the vision to take
                        personal computers to the next level. Therefore, they introduced the MS-DOS in 1981;
                        however, it was very difficult for the person to understand its cryptic commands.</li>
                    <li>Today, Windows has become the most popular and most commonly used operating system
                        technology. And then, Windows released various operating systems such as Windows 95, Windows
                        98, Windows XP and the latest operating system, Windows 7. Currently, most Windows users use
                        the Windows 10 operating system. Besides the Windows operating system, Apple is another
                        popular operating system built in the 1980s, and this operating system was developed by
                        Steve Jobs, a co-founder of Apple. They named the operating system Macintosh OS or Mac OS.

            <h2>Dual mode of OS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The dual mode operation in the OS ensures the proper execution of the operating system and shields
                    it from illegal users.</li>
                <li>Dual mode operation in OS means that there are two modes of the OS: One is user, and the other one
                    is kernel mode.</li>
                <li>While working in dual mode operation in OS, to discover the mode in which the current instruction is
                    getting executed, the mode bit is required. In case the value of the mode bit is 1, it operates in
                    user mode, and if it is 0, it operates in kernel mode.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>User mode</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When the computer system runs the user applications such as file creation , they do not have direct
                    access to the computer's hardware.</li>
                <li>In order to perform tasks hardware-related, such as when some interrupt occurs, the system must be
                    switched to kernel mode. </li>
                <li>For the user, the mode bit is 1, which implies that the system will be in the User Mode in case the
                    mode bit of the system's processor is 1.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Kernal mode</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>In the Kernel Mode, all of the bottom-level tasks of the OS are performed.</li>
                <li>The kernel mode takes care of all the processes which need hardware support because the Kernel space
                    has direct access to the system's hardware. Besides this, major Kernel Mode's functionality is the
                    execution of priviledged instructions.</li>
                <li>These privileged instructions lack user access, so they cannot be processed in user mode. Therefore,
                    all
                    of the instructions and processes that a user is only allowed to obstruct are carried out in the
                    kernel
                    mode of the operating system. </li>
                <li>For the Kernel Mode, the mode bit is 0. Hence, the Mode bit of processor must be equal to 0 for the
                    system to function in the Kernel Mode.</li>
                <li>Here are a few examples of privileged instructions: Input-Output management, Handling interrupts
                    etc.</li>

                <h3>Switching between User Mode and Kernel Mode</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A process gets executed in user mode and kernel mode in its lifetime. In the user mode, the
                        process
                        has limited access. On the other hand, the kernel mode is the privileged mode in which the
                        process
                        has
                        free access to system resources such as memory, hardware etc.</li>
                    <li> Services such as hardware I/O can be executed by accessing kernel data in kernel mode. Anything
                        linked with I/O hardware management, process management and memory management needs a process to
                        get
                        executed in Kernel mode. </li>
                    <li>In Kernel mode, a process gets the power to access any device and memory, but any kind of crash
                        in
                        kernel mode brings down the entire system. However, if there is any crash in user mode, it
                        brings
                        down only the faulty process.</li>
                    <li>The kernel offers SCI (System Call Interface), which acts as entry points for the user processes
                        to
                        enter into kernel mode. System calls are the only method by which a process can go from user
                        mode to
                        kernel mode.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Why is switching required?</h3>
                <p>Two primary reasons for switching between user mode and kernel mode are</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If every process were to run in a single mode only, it would end up with Microsoft's concern in
                        the
                        earlier versions of Windows. If any process were competent enough to exploit a vulnerability,
                        then
                        that process could control the system.</li>
                    <li>Some conditions are identified as a trap, a system fault or an exception usually caused by an
                        exceptional condition like invalid memory access, division by zero etc. Such a trap situation
                        can
                        crash the whole operating system if the process is in kernel mode. A process running in user
                        mode
                        that comes across a trap situation crashes the user-mode process only.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Therefore, switching overhead is essential for a more stable and secure system.</p>

                        computer or similar machine that will only have a single user at any given time.</li>
                    <li>This type of OS is typically used on devices like wireless phones and two-way messaging devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>A single task operating system can only run one program or application at a time. So it is not
                        as useful for a computer or other device intended to run multiple programs at once.</li>
                    <li>This is where a multitasking single-user operating system is used instead. A multitasking OS can
                        run multiple applications and programs at once.</li>
                    <li>This is often used on computers where someone may want to navigate the internet, run a graphics

                        processing program all at the same time. </li>
                    <li>A single task OS could not do this, but the multitasking systems can handle all these processes.

                        <li>There are some operating system examples like DOS, Windows 3x, Windows 95, 97, 98. Also, in
                            mobile phones, Symbian OS is single-user OS.</li>
                        <li>These systems are also known are single application OS as one application is concentrated at
                            a
                            time. These systems require fewer resources and can do processing in a queue. The recurring
                            tasks
                            are performed well in these systems, such as making payroll or employees' salaries.</li>

                    <p>Advantages of single user OS</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Supports one user at a time: in these systems, one user is only active at a time. So there
                            will be no other user interfering with the applications. And in these systems, all computer
                            resources are used by user requests.</li>
                        <li>Easy to maintain: these systems use fewer resources, and their complexity is less, making
                            them easy to maintain and debug. Higher resources are needed in a multi-user operating
                            system, and resources are used most of the time.</li>
                        <li>Less chance to damage: these systems include fewer requests to hardware and software at a
                            time, so they have less chance to damage. These systems do not make higher load time also.
                        </li>
                        <li>Concentrate on one task: in a modern OS, there are running multiple tasks at a time. Like
                            many applications and tasks are running simultaneously, but in single-user OS, only one task
                            runs at a time. So these systems give less output result at a time.</li>

                    <p>Disadvantages of single user OS</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tasks take longer to complete: As you know, many tasks are waiting for the CPU if no
                            multiple
                            tasks run at a time. So these systems respond to processes at a higher time. This will make
                            the
                            system slow, and response time is higher.</li>
                        <li>Idle time is higher: If only one task is running and this task doesn't require memory or I/O
                            use,
                            these devices remain idle. But other tasks need those devices. So only one task is run at a
                            time, then
                            other tasks have to wait till the first task is finished. So CPU, memory and disk I/O are
                            not used
                            properly.</li>

                        single-user operating system in that each user accesses the same operating system from
                        different machines.</li>
                    <li>The main goal of developing a multi-user operating system is to use it for time-sharing and
                        batch processing on mainframe systems. This multi-user operating system is now often
                        used in large organizations, the government sector, educational institutions like large
                        universities, and on servers side such as Ubuntu Server or Windows Server. These servers
                        allow several users to access the operating system, kernel, and hardware at the same time.</li>
                    <li>It is usually responsible for handling memory and processing for other running programs,
                        identifying and using system hardware, and efficiently handling user interaction and data
                        requests. It's specially important for an operating system, a multi-user operating system
                        because several users rely on the system to function properly at the same time.</li>

                    <p>Components of Multi-User OS</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Memory: The physical memory present inside the system is where storage occurs. It is also
                            known
                            as Random Access Memory (RAM). The system may rectify the data that is present in the main
                            memory. So, every executed program should be copied from physical storage like a hard disk.
                            Main memory is determined as an important part of OS because it specifies how many programs
                            may be executed simultaneously.</li>
                        <li>Kernel: A multi-user operating system makes use of the Kernel component, which is built in a
                            low-level
                            language. This component is embedded in the computer system's main memory and may interact
                            directly with the system's H/W.</li>
                        <li>Processor: The CPU (Central Processing Unit) of the computer is sometimes known as the
                            computer's brain.
                            In large machines, the CPU would necessitate more ICS. On smaller computers, the CPU is
                            mapped in a single chip known as a microprocessor.</li>
                        <li>User Interface: The user interface is the way of interaction between users and all software
                            and hardware processes.
                            It enables the users to interact with the computer system in a simple manner.</li>
                        <li>Device Handler: Each input and output device needs its device handler. The device handler's
                            primary goal is to
                            provide all requests from the whole device request queue pool. The device handler operates
                            in
                            continuous cycle mode, first discarding the I/O request block from the queue side.</li>
                        <li>Spooler: Spooler stands for 'Simultaneous Peripheral Output on Line'. The Spooler runs all
                            computer
                            processes and outputs the results at the same time. Spooling is used by a variety of output
                            devices,
                            including printers.</li>

                            computing
                            systems. Because it is based on Open System Architecture, tech giants including AIX,
                            Solaris, and
                            even Mac OS have their own version of Unix. For example, the Hospitality industry,

                            etc.</li>
                        <li>Multiple Virtual Storage: IBM develops an operating system for use on mainframe systems.
                            It's commonly utilized in
                            enterprise computing, where high-intensity I/O is required. For example, Banking, Insurance,
                            Aviation business, etc.</li>
                        <li>Shared computing: A multi-user OS is a software that operates the servers that support most
                            webmail apps. A typical
                            webmail application may require the utilization of hundreds of computers. Each one runs a
                            multi-
                            user operating system capable of supporting various users at the same time. Because these
                            systems
                            have millions, if not billions, of users who constantly log on to check their messages, they
                            require

                <h3>Batch OS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>In the 1970s, Batch processing was very popular. In this technique, similar types of jobs were
                        batched together and executed in time. People were used to having a single computer which was
                        called a mainframe.</li>
                    <li>In Batch operating system, access is given to more than one person; they submit their respective
                        jobs to the system for the execution.</li>
                    <li>The system put all of the jobs in a queue on the basis of first come first serve and then
                        executes
                        the jobs one by one. The users collect their respective output when all the jobs get executed.
                    </li>
                    <li>The user of this type of OS does not interact with the computer directly.</li>
                    <li>Each user prepares his job on an offline device like puch cards and submits it to the computer
                        operator.</li>
                    <li>There is an operator which takes similar jobs having the same requirement and group them into
                        batch.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/batch2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>The purpose of this OS was mainly to transfer control from one job to another as soon as the job
                        was completed. </li>
                    <li>It contained a small set of programs called the resident monitor that always resided in one part

                                <li>There are five jobs J1, J2, J3, J4 and J5, present in the batch. If the execution
                                    time of J1 is very high, then the other four jobs will never be executed, or they
                                    will have to wait for a very long time. Hence the other processes get starved.</li>
                                <li>The computer operators should be well known with batch systems.</li>
                                <li>Batch systems are hard to debug.</li>
                                <li>It is sometime costly.</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>Not interactive: Batch processing is not suitable for jobs that are dependent on the user's
                            input. If a job requires the input of two numbers from the console, then it will never get
                            it in the batch processing scenario since the user is not present at the time of execution.

                <h3>Real-Time OS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>A real-time operating system is a type of operating system designed to serve real-time
                        applications
                        that process data as it arrives.</li>
                    <li> It completes a task within a specific time.</li>
                    <li> The logical result of
                        computation and the time required to produce the result determine the correctness of the system
                        output.</li>
                    <li>It includes methods for real-time task scheduling</li>
                    <li>It is primarily used on embedded
                        systems.</li>
                    <li> It is highly useful for timing applications or activities that are performed within a
                        particular time limit. It uses strict time limits to drive task execution in an external
                        environment.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Applications of RTOS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Radar gadget.</li>
                    <li>Missile guidance.</li>
                    <li>Traffic manipulate gadget.</li>
                    <li>Autopilot travel simulators.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Types of RTOS</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hard Real-Time OS: All critical tasks must be completed within the specified time duration,
                        i.e., within the given deadline. Not meeting the deadline would result in critical failures such
                        as damage to equipment or even loss of human life.</li>
                    <li>Soft Real-Time OS: It accepts a few delays via the means of the Operating system. In this kind
                        of RTOS, there may be a closing date needed for a particular job, but a delay for a small
                        amount of time is acceptable. So, cut off dates are treated softly via means of this kind of
                        RTOS.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p>Advantages of RTOS</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There's a quick response during task performance.</li>
                        <li>It minimizes the idle time of the processor.</li>
                        <li>All tasks get an equal chance of being accomplished.</li>
                        <li>It reduces the chance of software duplication.</li>
                        <li>A real-time operating system often takes less time to shift from one task to another. Tasks
                            are
                            typically switched in 3 microseconds or less. This type of expedited task management ensures
                            that
                            key processes are performed on time.</li>
                        <li>An RTOS is a system that is available 24/7 because it produces maximum results. As a result,
                            it is
                            suited for applications that must run at all times.</li>
                        <li>Real-time operating systems, particularly those based on hard RTOS, are completely
                            error-free. It
                            ensures a more effective way of handling the errors. Furthermore, operating systems
                            experience
                            with jitter, an issue in which the number of errors between loops is measured. A correctly
                            programmed RTOS can be optimized so that it suffers fewer jitters</li>

                </div>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p>Disadvantages of RTOS</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The user's data security might be a problem.</li>
                        <li>System failure can lead to widespread failures.</li>
                        <li>Problems in data communication may arise.</li>
                        <li>A Real-Time operating system constantly experiences signal interruptions. As a result, the
                            needed drivers must be loaded on the computer in order to get consistent speed. With the
                            help of drivers, an RTOS will be able to respond quickly whenever an interruption occurs.
                        </li>
                        <li>As mentioned earlier, an RTOS focuses on only one application at a time. It is used to
                            maintain accuracy and reduce errors. All other low-priority applications need to be on
                            waiting.</li>
                        <li>Although a real-time operating system (RTOS) can focus on specific applications, it is not
                            the same as multitasking. They are only designed to run some of the tasks.</li>
                        <li>Program crashes may often be experienced while using a Real-Time operating system.
                            Unlike a regular O/S, an RTOS may not efficiently separate memory domains. As a result,
                            processes would have a problem addressing them.</li>

                        <li>Complex algorithms are behind an RTOS interface. These algorithms will be difficult to
                            write for a typical user. Only a professional developer will be able to write and understand
                            them.</li>

            <h2>Structure of OS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>An operating system is a construct that allows the user application programs to interact with the
                    system hardware. </li>
                <li>Since the operating system is such a complex structure, it should be created with
                    utmost care so it can be used and modified easily.</li>
                <li>An easy way to do this is to create the operating
                    system in parts. Each of these parts should be well defined with clear inputs, outputs and
                    functions.</li>

                <h3>Simple Structure</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There are many operating systems that have a rather simple structure.</li>
                    <li>These started as small systems and rapidly expanded much further than their scope.</li>
                    <li>A common example of this is MS-DOS. It was designed for a niche amount for people, there was no
                        indication that it would become so popular.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>It is better that operating systems have a modular structure, unlike MS-DOS. That would lead to
                        greater control over the computer system and its various applications. The modular structure
                        would also allow the programmers to hide information as required and implement internal routines
                        as they see it without changing the outer specifications.</li>

            <h2>System Calls</h2>
            <h3>Methodologies for implementation of O/S service System Calls:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Basically the <b>system call</b> is an instruction that request the OS to perform the desired
                    operation that needs <b>hardware access or other priviliged operations.</b></li>
                <li>For performing any operation a user must have to request for a service call which is known as the
                    <b>system call.</b> Or we can say:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programming interface to the services provided by the OS.</li>
                        <li>They are typically written in a high-level language (C or C++).</li>
                        <li>There are two modes in the operation of system which is user mode or system mode.
                            <ul>
                                <li>In <b>user mode</b> all user processes are executed.</li>
                                <li>In <b>system mode</b> all privileged operations are executed.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The user programs and kernel functions are being executed in their respective space alloted in the
                    main memory partitions.</li>
                <li>User mode programs need to execute some privileged operations, which are not permitted in user mode
                    functions, user mode programs must use an interface, which forms the only permitted interface
                    between user mode functions and kernel mode.</li>
                <li>This interface is called system calls.</li>
                <li>So system call is an interface between the user programs and the OS.</li>
                <li>System calls expose all kernel functionalities that user mode programs require.</li>
                <li>Basically the system call is an instruction that request the OS to perform the desired oepration
                    that needs hardware access or other privileged operations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>System call generates an interrupt that causes the OS to gain control of the CPU. The OS then finds
                    out the type of system call and the corresponding interrupt handler routine is executed to perform
                    the operation.</i></p>

            <ul>
                <li>System calls are inherently used for security reasons. Due to the use of system calls, a user
                    program is not able to enter into OS or any other user's region. Similarly, I/O devices are also

                    <li>Now system calls are directly available and used in high level languages like C & C++. So it has

                    <li>For a programmers, system calls are same as calling a procedure or function.</li>
                    <li>The difference between a system call and a normal function call is that a system call enter a

                <h3>Executing the system call</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a sequence of steps to execute a system call.</li>
                    <li>For this, there is the need to pass various parameters of system call to the OS.</li>
                    <li>For passing these parameters to the OS, three methods are used as follow :
                        <ol>
                            <li>Register method, where in the parameters are stored in registers of the CPU.</li>
                            <li>If parameters are not in number, compared to the size of registers, a block of memory is
                                used and the address of that block is stored in register.</li>
                            <li>Stack method, where in parameters are pushed onto stack and popped of by the OS.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Sequence in which system call is executed</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In the user program when the system call is executed, first of all, its parameters are pushed
                        onto the stack and later on saved in processor registers.</li>
                    <li>The corresponding library procedure for the system call is executed.</li>
                    <li>There is a particular code for every system call by which the kernel identifies which system
                        call function or handler needs to be executed. Therefore library procedure places the system
                        call number in the processor register.</li>
                    <li>Then the library procedure traps to the kernel by executing interrupt instruction, with this
                        interrupt execution, the user mode switches to kernel mode by loading program status word (PSW)
                        register to 0.</li>
                    <li>The hardware saves the current contents of CPU registers, so that after executing the system
                        call, the execution of the rest of the program can be resumed.</li>
                    <li>The kernel identifies the system call by examining its number and dispatches the control to the
                        corresponding system call handler.</li>
                    <li>The system call handler executes.</li>
                    <li>On completion of system call handler, the control is returned to the user program and it resumes
                        its execution.</li>

                <h3>Sysmtem calls vs library function</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>A system call is a request made by a program to the operating system kernel to perform an
                        operation on its behalf, such as creating a new process, reading or writing a file, or
                        allocating memory. System calls are implemented by the operating system and are executed in
                        kernel mode, which provides the necessary privileges to access system resources.</li>
                    <li>On the other hand, a library function is a pre-written block of code that performs a specific
                        task and is packaged with the application. Library functions are executed in user mode and
                        provide a higher-level abstraction than system calls. For example, the C standard library
                        provides functions such as printf() and scanf() for performing input and output operations,
                        which internally make system calls to access system resources.</li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>System calls are typically used for low-level operations that require direct access to system
                        resources, while library functions provide a higher-level interface that simplifies common tasks
                        and abstracts away system-specific details.</li>

        <div class="wh">
            <p>Q- We have stressed the need for an operating system to make efficient use of the computing hardware.
                When is it appropriate for the operating system to forsake this principle and to "waste" resources? Why
                is such as system not really wasteful?</p>
            <div class="in">
                <p>Answer &darr;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the primary goal of an operating system is to make efficient use of computing hardware,
                        there may be situations where it is appropriate for the operating system to "waste" resources.
                        One such situation is when the operating system is providing a high level of security or
                        reliability. In this case, the operating system may need to use more resources than necessary to
                        ensure that the system is secure and reliable.</li>
                    <li>For example, if an operating system is running a critical application, it may need to allocate
                        more resources to that application to ensure that it runs smoothly and does not crash. This may
                        mean that other applications running on the system may have less resources available to them,
                        but the priority is to ensure that the critical application is able to function as required.
                    </li>
                    <li>Another example is when the operating system is running in a virtualized environment. In this
                        case, the operating system may need to allocate more resources to the virtual machines running
                        on it to ensure that they are isolated from each other and have enough resources to function
                        properly. This may mean that the host operating system itself has less resources available to
                        it, but the priority is to ensure that the virtual machines are able to function as required.
                    </li>
                    <li>Despite the apparent waste of resources in these situations, it is important to remember that
                        the operating system is still serving a purpose. By allocating more resources to certain tasks,
                        the operating system is ensuring that the overall system is functioning as required, which can
                        lead to increased security, reliability, and performance. Therefore, while it may seem wasteful
                        at first glance, such a system is not truly wasteful as it is still serving a valuable purpose
                        in the larger context of the system.</li>

            <p>Q- Under what circumstances would a user be better off using a time sharing system than a PC or a
                single-user workstation?</p>
            <div class="in">
                <p>Answer &darr;</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A user may be better off using a time-sharing system rather than a PC or a single-user
                        workstation under the following circumstances:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Limited hardware resources: If the user has limited access to computing hardware, such
                                as memory, storage, or processing power, a time-sharing system can provide access to
                                shared resources that are not available on their personal device. This can be
                                particularly beneficial for complex tasks that require more resources than a user's
                                personal device can provide.</li>
                            <li>Collaborative work: If the user needs to collaborate with other users on a project or
                                task, a time-sharing system can provide a shared environment where multiple users can
                                work on the same project simultaneously. This can be particularly beneficial for tasks
                                that require multiple users to work on the same file or program.</li>
                            <li>Remote access: If the user needs to access computing resources from a remote location, a
                                time-sharing system can provide remote access to computing resources via the internet or
                                other network connections. This can be particularly beneficial for users who travel
                                frequently or work remotely.</li>
                            <li>Software availability: If the user needs access to specialized software or applications
                                that are not available on their personal device, a time-sharing system can provide
                                access to shared resources that have the required software or applications. This can be
                                particularly beneficial for users who need access to specialized software for a limited
                                period of time or for infrequent use.</li>
                            <li>Cost-effectiveness: If the user does not have the financial resources to purchase or
                                maintain their own personal device, a time-sharing system can provide access to
                                computing resources at a lower cost than purchasing and maintaining their own personal
                                device. This can be particularly beneficial for users who have limited financial
                                resources or who only need access to computing resources for a limited period of time.

                <ul>
                    <li>In a multi-programming and time-sharing environment, several users share the system
                        simultaneously, which can result in various security problems. Two such problems are:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Unauthorized access: In a shared system, it is possible for users to gain unauthorized
                                access to data or resources that they are not authorized to access. This can happen if a
                                user gains access to another user's account or if a user exploits a vulnerability in the
                                system to gain access to resources that they should not be able to access. Unauthorized
                                access can lead to data breaches, theft of intellectual property, and other security
                                incidents.</li>
                            <li>Data confidentiality: In a shared system, it is possible for users to access or view
                                data that they are not authorized to view. This can happen if a user gains access to
                                another user's files or if a user is able to intercept network traffic and view
                                sensitive data in transit. Data confidentiality is important for protecting sensitive
                                information, such as personal identifying information, financial data, and intellectual
                                property.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To mitigate these security problems, it is important to implement appropriate security
                                measures, such as access control mechanisms, encryption, and monitoring and auditing
                                tools. Users should also be educated on best practices for maintaining security in a
                                shared environment, such as choosing strong passwords, logging out of shared systems
                                when not in use, and reporting any suspicious activity to system administrators.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Ensuring the same degree of security in a time-shared machine as in a dedicated machine can be
                        challenging, but it is possible to achieve a high level of security in both environments with
                        appropriate security measures.
                        <ul>
                            <li>In a dedicated machine, there is typically only one user who has access to the system,
                                which can make it easier to enforce security policies and control access to resources.
                                In contrast, in a time-shared environment, multiple users share the same system, which
                                can make it more difficult to enforce security policies and control access to resources.
                                Additionally, in a time-shared environment, there is a greater risk of unauthorized
                                access or data breaches, since multiple users have access to the same resources.</li>
                            <li>To ensure a high degree of security in a time-shared machine, it is important to
                                implement appropriate security measures, such as:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Access control mechanisms: To prevent unauthorized access, access control
                                        mechanisms such as passwords, encryption, and multi-factor authentication can be
                                        implemented. User accounts should be created with appropriate access levels and
                                        permissions, and users should only be granted access to the resources they need
                                        to perform their tasks.</li>
                                    <li>Encryption: To protect sensitive data, encryption should be used to ensure that
                                        data is protected when it is transmitted or stored on the system.</li>
                                    <li>Monitoring and auditing tools: To detect and prevent security incidents,
                                        monitoring and auditing tools can be used to track user activity and identify
                                        any suspicious behavior.</li>
                                    <li>Regular security updates and patches: To prevent known vulnerabilities from
                                        being exploited, regular security updates and patches should be applied to the
                                        system.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>While it may be more challenging to ensure the same degree of security in a time-shared
                                machine as in a dedicated machine, by implementing appropriate security measures, it is

            <ul>
                <li>The <b>kernel</b> is the core component of an operating system that provides basic services such as
                    memory management, process management, and device driver management. It is responsible for managing
                    the system resources and providing a secure and stable environment for applications to run. The
                    kernel runs in privileged mode and has access to all system resources.</li>
                <li>The <b>shell</b> is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating
                    system. It provides a way to execute commands and run applications by interpreting user input and
                    passing it to the kernel for execution. The shell provides various commands and utilities for
                    performing operations such as file management, process management, and system configuration. There
                    are different types of shells available, such as bash, zsh, csh, and ksh, each with their own
                    features and capabilities.</li>
                <li>A <b>system call</b> is a mechanism provided by the operating system for applications to access
                    system resources such as files, memory, and devices. It provides a secure way for applications to
                    interact with the kernel and access system resources by invoking a set of predefined functions.
                    System calls are executed in privileged mode and provide a bridge between the user space and kernel
                    space. Examples of system calls include creating a new process, opening a file, reading or writing
                    data from a file, and allocating memory.</li>

                        <li>File management: The operating system manages files and directories on the system and
                            provides utilities for creating, modifying, and deleting files.</li>
                        <li>Process management: The operating system manages processes and threads on the system and
                            provides utilities for starting, stopping, and managing processes.</li>
                        <li>Memory management: The operating system manages memory allocation and provides utilities for
                            allocating and deallocating memory for processes.</li>
                        <li>Device management: The operating system manages devices on the system and provides utilities
                            for configuring and accessing devices such as printers, scanners, and input/output devices.
                        </li>
