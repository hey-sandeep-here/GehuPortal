                <h3>Social Wellbeing</h3>
                <p>Social wellbeing refers to the physical, social, and psychological health and well-being of
                    individuals within their social environment. It encompasses the individual's relationships,
                    activities, and engagement within their social network. Here are some notes on social wellbeing
                    concepts:
                <ol>
                    <li>Socialization: Socialization refers to the process by which individuals learn to navigate the
                        social interactions, norms, and values in their culture. Socialization is an ongoing process
                        that begins in early childhood and continues throughout life.</li>
                    <li>Individualization: Individualization refers to the process by which individuals develop an
                        independent and self-sufficient identity, often at the expense of their social relationships and
                        support. This process is common in Western societies, where there is a greater emphasis on
                        individual rights and responsibilities.</li>
                    <li>Social control: Social control refers to the social and cultural norms, rules, and values that
                        influence an individual's behavior and interactions within society. For example, there are
                        social norms and expectations around dress, language, and behavior that can influence an
                        individual's acceptance or rejection within their community.</li>
                    <li>Influence of culture on health and fitness: The cultural context in which individuals live and
                        interact can significantly influence their health and fitness. For example, cultural values and
                        norms around diet, exercise, and stress management can have a profound impact on an individual's
                        physical and mental health. Additionally, cultural attitudes and beliefs around healthcare
                        seeking and utilization can also affect health outcomes.</li>

            <h2>Spiritual & intellectual health</h2>
            <p>
                Spiritual and intellectual health are two important components of overall well-being that can have a
                profound impact on our sense of fulfillment and prosperity.
            <ol>
                <li>Spiritual health refers to the inner dimension of our lives, and includes our beliefs, values,
                    and spiritual practices, as well as our sense of meaning and purpose. Good spiritual health
                    involves cultivating a sense of connection and oneness with something greater than ourselves,
                    whether through meditation, prayer, or other practices. Spiritually healthy individuals are
                    often more compassionate, peaceful, and confident.</li>
                <li>Intellectual health refers to the development of our mental abilities and our overall level of
                    cognitive function. This includes our ability to reason, analyze, and problem-solve, as well as
                    our memory, vocabulary, and spatial skills. Intellectual health is important for academic
                    success and for maintaining high levels of mental performance over time. Good intellectual
                    health involves continuing to learn and develop our skills throughout our lives.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p><b>Ethics and morals:</b> Morals refer to individual principles that guide one's
                behavior, while ethics refer to a larger system of principles that regulate behavior within a group.
                Good morals involve living according to a personal code of conduct that values honesty, decency, and
                integrity, while good ethics involves living according to a larger set of rules and standards that
                promote the broader social good. A balanced approach to ethics and morals can help individuals and
                communities thrive by promoting good decision-making and behavior that benefits both oneself and
                others.</p>

            <h2>Occupational health</h2>
            <p>Occupational health refers to the impact of one's job on their physical, mental, and social
                wellbeing. Occupational hazards refer to the potential risks and exposures that can occur in the
                workplace, while occupational health management refers to the practices and systems in place to
                mitigate those risks.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Hazards: Occupational hazards are any conditions or substances in the workplace that can cause
                    harm or injury to workers. These include physical hazards such as heavy lifting, repetitive
                    motion, and exposure to fumes, noise, or vibrations; chemical hazards such as exposure to toxins
                    or carcinogenic substances; and ergonomic hazards such as poor workstation design or
                    uncomfortable working positions.</li>
                <li>Management: Occupational health management involves implementing practices and systems to
                    mitigate the risks posed by occupational hazards. This can include providing proper training and
                    equipment to workers, setting clear safety standards, conducting workplace assessments to
                    identify and address hazards, and providing access to healthcare services and worker
                    compensation.</li>
                <li>Risk assessment: A key component of occupational health management is conducting risk
                    assessments to identify and evaluate the potential hazards in a workplace. This involves
                    evaluating the tasks workers perform and assessing the risks associated with those tasks, such
                    as the potential for exposure to hazardous substances or the risk of injury from operating
                    machinery.</li>
                <li>Prevention: Occupational health management practices aim to prevent exposure to hazards in the
                    first place, through measures such as engineering controls, administrative controls, and
                    personal protective equipment.</li>
                <li>Mitigation: In cases where it is not possible to eliminate a hazard entirely, Occupational
                    health management practices focus on mitigating the risks posed by the hazard, through measures
                    such as limiting exposure, providing workers with training, and providing access to healthcare
                    services if necessary.</li>
