                <li>Knowing your strengths and weaknesses is an important step in maintaining mental health.</li>
                <li>Strengths can be utilized to enhance confidence and achieve goals while weaknesses can be addressed

            <ul>
                <li>Anger is a normal and natural emotion but can become a problem when it leads to unhealthy and
                    destructive behavior.</li>
                <li>Managing anger involves recognizing triggers, expressing feelings constructively, and practicing
                    self-control techniques like deep breathing or mindfulness.</li>

            <h2>Burnout syndrome</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Burnout is a state of exhaustion, both physical and emotional, that can occur in response to
                    prolonged stress and lack of work-life balance. It can manifest itself through symptoms like
                    fatigue, lack of motivation, and a sense of detachment from work. Self-care, boundaries, and
                    self-reflection are important for preventing and managing burnout.</li>

            <h2>Academic stress & test anxiety</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Academic stress and test anxiety can negatively impact mental health by causing feelings of
                    overwhelm, insecurity, and low self-confidence. Self-compassion and effective study strategies can
                    help manage academic stress and test anxiety such as time management, regular breaks, and exercise.

            <h2>Problem solving behaviour</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Effective problem-solving skills can foster resilience and confidence in tackling challenges. When
                    approaching conflicts, it's important to focus on identifying the problem, exploring options, and
                    choosing a course of action. Mindfulness and self-compassion can help manage emotional reactions
                    during the problem-solving process.</li>

                        stress, anxiety, and isolation. Taking a break from digital devices through a digital detox can
                        restore balance and promote mindfulness and resilience.</li>

            <h2>Decision making</h2>

                <li>Effective decision making skills require self-reflection, seeking information and multiple
                    perspectives, and considering potential outcomes. When making important decisions, it's important to
                    be aware of one's cognitive biases and to practice critical thinking.</li>

                    such as decluttering and organizing routines, can promote mental well-being by reducing stress and
                    improving confidence.</li>

                    mental wellness. Incorporating mindfulness practices into daily life, such as meditation or
                    breathing exercises, can improve emotional regulation and promote resilience.</li>

                    confide in, to express emotions, and to provide emotional and practical help can improve self-esteem
                    and reduce stress.</li>

                    well-being. Engaging in activities that bring joy and relaxation, such as exercise, yoga, or
