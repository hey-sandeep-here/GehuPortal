        <h1>Stress</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Stress is a response of the body to a perception of threat or demand. Stress can be physical, mental, or
                emotional in nature and can have positive or negative effects depending on how it is managed. Common
                stressors include work deadlines, financial pressure, family conflicts, and health concerns. Long-term
                exposure to stress can lead to negative physical and mental health outcomes.</li>

                <li>Acute stress: Occurring in response to a single, specific, short-term threat, such as a job
                    interview or public speaking.</li>
                <li>Chronic stress: Occurring in response to ongoing stressors over an extended period of time, such as

                <li>Traumatic stress: Occurring in response to an abrupt, life-threatening event, such as a natural
                    disaster or an assault.</li>
                <li>Toxic stress: Occurring in a person, especially a young child, living in extreme poverty, where
                    chronic stressors are compounded and resources are limited.</li>

            <h2>Stressors</h2>
            <p>A stressor is a factor or event that triggers a stress response in an individual. Stressors can be

                they are managed. Common stressors include work deadlines, financial pressure, family conflicts, and

                <li>Physiological: Such as sleep deprivation or chronic pain.</li>

            <h2>Stress management</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Stress management: Stress is a natural and normal response to stressors in our daily lives. When
                    managed effectively, stress can be motivating and productive, but when allowed to accumulate, stress
                    can lead to negative health effects and impairment. Effective stress management involves identifying
                    stressors, recognizing signs of stress, and developing coping mechanisms to maintain emotional and
                    physical well-being.</li>
                <li>Identifying stressors: Identifying stressors is an important first step in managing stress. Common
                    stressors include work pressure, relationship problems, financial worries, and health concerns. It
                    can be helpful to create a stress log to identify the sources of stress and to identify which
                    stressors have the greatest impact on one's mental health.</li>
                <li>Recognizing signs of stress: Recognizing signs of stress is important for taking proactive steps to
                    manage stress. Common signs of stress include physical symptoms like headaches, upset stomach, and
                    tension aches, as well as emotional symptoms like irritability, anxiety, and depression. It's
                    important to acknowledge stress and find ways to manage it before it becomes debilitating.</li>
                <li>Coping mechanisms: Coping mechanisms are tools we use to manage stress and regulate emotions. There
                    are many different coping mechanisms, including physical activity, mindfulness meditation,
                    journaling, and spending time in nature. It's important to try different coping mechanisms to find
                    what works best for you, as what works for one person may not work for another.</li>
                <li>Self-care and boundaries: Self-care is an important component of stress management. This includes
                    taking care of one's physical and emotional needs through healthy habits like exercising, eating a
                    balanced diet, and getting enough sleep. Boundaries are important for maintaining one's well-being
                    and preventing overcommitment and burnout. It's important to prioritize self-care and healthy
                    boundaries to manage stress.</li>
                <li>Mindfulness and meditation: Mindfulness is the practice of non-judgmentally paying attention to the
                    present moment without getting absorbed by one's thoughts or emotions. Meditation is a mindfulness
                    practice that involves quietly focusing the attention on a single object, such as the breath, or on
                    the sense of awareness itself. Mindfulness and meditation have been shown to be effective in
                    reducing stress levels and promoting emotional regulation.</li>
                <li>Exercise: Exercise is a powerful tool for managing stress by releasing endorphins and promoting
                    physical and mental health. Exercise can also provide a physical outlet for stress by allowing the
                    body to release excess energy and tension. It's important to find a form of exercise that one enjoys
                    and incorporates it</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Stress cycle</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The stress cycle is a cycle of physiological and psychological processes that occurs in response to
                    a stressor.</li>
                <li>The stress cycle typically starts with the exposure to a stressor, which triggers a physiological
                    response such as an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and cortisol levels.</li>
                <li> This physiological response then leads to negative thoughts and emotions, which can further
                    perpetuate the stress cycle. To break the stress cycle, it's important to identify and manage one's
                    physiological and psychological stress responses.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Stress management technique & strategies:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify stressors: Keep a stress journal to identify what triggers stress, and prioritize what is
                    most important.</li>
                <li>Engage in physical activity: Exercise can help release tension, boost endorphins, and improve mood.
                </li>
                <li>Practice mindfulness and relaxation: Mindfulness meditation, deep breathing, and progressive muscle
                    relaxation are proven techniques for relaxation and stress management.</li>
                <li>Connect with others: Social support is essential for stress management. Reach out to family and
                    friends, join a support group, or participate in online forums.</li>
                <li>Prioritize self-care: Healthy diet.</li>
