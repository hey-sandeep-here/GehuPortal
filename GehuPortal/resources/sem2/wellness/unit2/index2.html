            <h3>Balanced diet</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A balanced diet is the key to good health. A balanced diet consists of a variety of foods from
                    all
                    food groups, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and dairy products.
                    Eating a
                    well-balanced diet can help to provide the body with the nutrients it needs to function
                    optimally
                    and prevent nutrient deficiencies and diseases.</li>
            </ul>

        <div id="t2" class="wh">
            <h3>Food hygiene</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Food hygiene is essential for preventing foodborne illnesses. Good food hygiene practices
                    include
                    washing hands regularly, cleaning surfaces and equipment frequently, and avoiding
                    cross-contamination between raw and cooked foods. Following good food hygiene practices can help
                    to
                    prevent the spread of foodborne illnesses, such as salmonella and E. coli.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="t3" class="wh">
            <h3>Food habits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Food habits play a significant role in overall health. Eating healthy foods regularly and
                    avoiding
                    unhealthy foods can help to promote good health and prevent weight gain, diabetes, heart
                    disease,
                    and other chronic diseases. On the other hand, an unhealthy diet can lead to the development of
                    obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other health problems.</li>

            <h3>Dietary requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dietary requirements vary based on a person's age, gender, and physical activity level. In
                    general,
                    adults need approximately 2,000 calories per day to meet their daily dietary requirements.
                    Children
                    and teenagers typically need more calories per day than adults as they are growing and
                    developing.

            <h3>Deficiency diseases</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Deficiency diseases can occur if the body is not receiving enough nutrients from the diet.
                    Deficiency diseases, such as scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and anemia (iron deficiency), can
                    lead to
                    serious health problems, such as fatigue, weakness, and increased risk of infections. Eating a
                    balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods can help to prevent nutrient
                    deficiencies and deficiency diseases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Below are some examples of deficiency diseases along with the nutrient they are caused by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scurvy: Vitamin C deficiency that can lead to wounds not healing properly, bleeding gums, and
                    anemia.</li>
                <li>Beri-beri: Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency that can lead to impaired mental functioning,
                    cardiac problems, and muscle weakness.</li>
                <li>Pellagra: Niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency that can cause skin problems, gastrointestinal issues,
                    and dementia-like symptoms.</li>
                <li>Rickets: Vitamin D deficiency that can lead to weakened bones and joints, bone deformities, and
                    stunted growth in children.</li>
                <li>Rickets: Vitamin D deficiency that can lead to weakened bones and joints, bone deformities, and
                    stunted growth in children.</li>
                <li>Kwashiorkor: Protein and essential amino acid (leucine, methionine, and tryptophan) deficiency
                    that can lead to swelling in the abdomen, diarrhea, and poor wound healing.</li>
                <li>Iron deficiency anemia: Iron deficiency that can lead to fatigue, anemia, and decreased immune
                    function.</li>
                <li>Vitamin A deficiency: Vitamin A deficiency that can lead to impaired vision, increased
                    susceptibility to infection, and birth defects.</li>
                <li>Folate deficiency anemia: Folate (vitamin B9) deficiency that can lead to anemia, mouth sores,
                    and fetal neural tube defects.</li>
                <li>Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia: Vitamin B12 deficiency that can lead to anemia, neurological
                    problems, and fatigue.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>In conclusion, good nutrition and healthy food choices play a vital role in maintaining good health. By
            following a balanced diet, practicing good food hygiene, and making healthy food choices, individuals
            can optimize their health and promote their well-being. It's always a good idea to consult with a
            registered dietitian or healthcare provider for guidance on individual dietary needs and for assistance
            in creating a personalized nutrition plan.</p>
