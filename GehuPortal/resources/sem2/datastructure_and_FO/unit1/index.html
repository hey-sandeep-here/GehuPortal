            <h2>Algorithm Complexity</h2>
            <p>Algorithm complexity refers to the amount of time and /or space requried by an algorithm to solve a
                problem. It is a measure of how efficient an algorithm is, and it is typically expressed as a function
                of the size of the input. <br>There are two types of algorithm complexity:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Time complexity: This refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to solve a problem, as a
                    function of the size of the input. <ul>
                        <li>The time complexity is usually measured in terms of the number of operations or steps the
                            algorithm takes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Space complexity: This refers to the amount of memory an alogrithm requiers to solve a problem, as a
                    function of the size of the input.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Space complexity is usually measured in terms of the amount of memory required for the
                            input, the output, and any additional storage required by the algorithm</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Both time and space complexity are important factors to consider when analyzing the performance of an
                algorithm. A good algorithm should have a low time and space complexity, meaning that it should be able
                to solve a problem quickly and with minimal use of memory. On the other hand, a poor algorithm may have
                a high time and space complexity, which can lead to slow performance or even failure to solve the
                problem for large input sizes.</p>

            </ul>
            <p>
                Example:
            <pre>

          A           B
time    10 sec      15 sec  
space   40 mb       13 mb

Algorithm A is more efficient tham B

          A           B
time    10 sec      10 sec  
space   15 mb        3 mb

Algorithm B is more efficient tham A

            <h2>Time-space trade-off</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>S &Proportional; 1 / T</li>
                <li>Time-space trade-off is a concept in computer science that involves making a choice between using
                    more time to execute an algorithm or using more space to store data in order to optimize the overall
                    performance of the algorithm.</li>
                <li>This trade-off between time and space complexity is often influenced by the specific requirements of
                    the problem being solved and the available resources. For example, in a system with limited memory,
                    it may be necessary to prioritize space efficiency over time efficiency to ensure that the algorithm
                    can run at all. In contrast, in a system with abundant memory, it may be more practical to
                    prioritize time efficiency over space efficiency to achieve faster performance.</li>
                <li>In general, the goal of time-space trade-off is to find the optimal balance between time and space
                    complexity for a given problem, taking into account the available resources and the specific
                    requirements of the problem being solved.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>When there is nested iteration, meaning having a loop in a loop and inner loop is dependent on
                        outer loop, here the time complexity is
                        quadratic, which is horrible.</li>
                    <li>A perfect way to explain this would be if you have an array with n items. The outer loop will
                        run n times, and the inner loop will run n times for each iteration of the outer loop, which
                        will give total n<sup>2</sup> prints. If the array has ten items, it will print 100 times
                        (10<sup>2</sup>).</li>

                    <li>This is similar to linear time complexity, except that the runtime does not depend on the input
                        size but rather on half the input size.</li>
                    <li>When the input size decreases on each iteration or step, an algorithm is said to have
                        logarithmic time complexity.</li>
                    <li>Certain divide and conquer algorithms based on linear functionality.</li>
                    <li>This method is the second best because programs run for half the input size rather than the full

                    <li>A great example is binary search functions, which divide your sorted array based on the target

                <li>Drop the constants:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anything you might think is O(kn) (where k is a constant) is O(n) as well. This is
                            considered a better representation of the time complexity since the k term would not affect
                            the complexity much for a higher value of n.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Drop the non-dominant terms:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Anything you represent as O(n^2+n) can be written as O(n^2). Similar to when non-dominant
                            terms are ignored for a higher value of n.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Consider all variables which are provided as input:
                    <ul>
                        <li>O(mn) and O(mnq) might exist for some cases.</li>
                        <li>In most cases, we try to represent the runtime in terms of the inputs which can even be more
                            than one in number. For example, The time taken to paint a park of dimension m*n â†’ O(kmn) â†’
