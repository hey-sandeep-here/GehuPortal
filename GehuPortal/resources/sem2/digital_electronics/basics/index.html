        <div class="wh">
            <ul>
                <li>Electrical engineering is a professional engineering discipline that generally deals with the study
                    and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism (higher voltages)</li>
                <li>Electronic engineering is a branch of electrical engineering where we work on low voltage devices
                    such as semiconductors, transistors, diodes, integrated circuits.</li>
                <li>In electronic engineering we study two types of systems: analog and digital system.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Difference between digital and analog system</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Analog system: continuous value is used to denote the information. Analog signals is defined as any
                    physical quantity which varies continously with respect to time, e.g. apmlifier, ecg, watch, radio,
                    etc.</li>
                <li>Digital system: information is denoted by a finite sequence of discrete values or digits. Digital
                    signals is defined as any physical quantity having discrete values, e.g. digital watch, calculator,
                    bp machine, thermometer, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Advantage of digital system &darr;</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Digital system are easy to design because they do not require sound engineering and mathematical
                    knowledge, uses only switching circuits.</li>
                <li>Storage for long time and processing of information is easy.</li>
                <li>They provide better accuracy and precision.</li>
                <li>Less affected by noise like sound electric field, magnetic field.</li>
                <li>Better modularity and easy fabrication, it means size will be vary small, e.g. IC.</li>
                <li>Less cost.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Importance of digital system</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Digital system have sucha prominent role in everyday life (digital age).</li>
                <li>Digital system used in communication, business, traffic control, space guidance, medical, industry,
                    science, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Lets try to understand designing of digital device using which we will understand the entire process.</p>
            <p>Q- Design a warning system for a car manufacturing company with three inputs light, day, engine?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Steps to remember
                    <ol>
                        <li>Understand problem</li>
                        <li>Design a truth table</li>
                        <li>Write boolean expression</li>
                        <li>Minimize boolean expression</li>
                        <li>Implement using logic gates</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/t1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>After making table next step is to write a boolean expression.</li>
                <li>Boolean expression in easy words: we have to remember where we have either 0 or 1.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/t2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>Between SOP and POS which is prior?
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use whichever has the minimun elements.</li>
                        <li>But minterms are more friendly so we usually use it.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Boolean expression &darr;</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/t3.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>After making expression we have to make a circuit which should be less costly. To minimize the cost
                    we use process like K-map, etc.</li>
