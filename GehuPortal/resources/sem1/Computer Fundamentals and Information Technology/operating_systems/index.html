                            <li>It includes various tasks like <b>scheduling, termination</b> of the process.</li>
                            <li>OS manages various tasks at a time.</li>
                            <li>Here <b>CPU Scheduling</b> happens means all the tasks would be done by the many

                            <li>The operating system has to keep track, how much memory has been used and by whom.</li>
                            <li>It has to decide which process needs memory space and how much.</li>

                            <li>For example, Windows uses <b>Kerberos</b> authentication to prevent unauthorized access
                                to data.</li>

                                <li>The input to an assembler is an assembly language program. The output is an object
                                    program plus information that enables the loader to prepare the object program for

                                <li>A compiler is a program that accepts a source program in a “high-level language “and
                                    produces a corresponding object program.</li>
                                <li>An interpreter is a program that appears to execute a source program as if it was
                                    machine language.</li>
                                <li>The same name (FORTRAN, COBOL, etc.) is often used to designate both a compiler and

                                <li>There are various loading schemes: absolute, relocating, and direct-linking.</li>
                                <li>In general, the loader must load, relocate and link the object program.</li>
                                <li>The loader is a program that places it in the core.</li>
                                <li>The loader places into memory the machine language version of the user's program and
                                    tranfers control to it.</li>
                                <li>Since the loader program is much smaller than the assembler, those make more core

                            required to restart it while it is ON. Therefore, in this condition the warm boot takes

                            drives, etc. Moreover, if any error occurs, the system produces a beep sound.</li>

                            operating system starts working and executes all the initial files and instructions.</li>
                        <li>System Configuration &rarr; In this step, the drivers are loaded into the main memory.
                            Drivers are programs that help in the functioning of the peripheral devices.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>It was gradually superseded by operating systems offering a graphical user interface (GUI) in
                        various graphical Microsoft Windows operating system generations.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>DOS is also used to describe several similar command-line disk operating systems.</li>
            <li>Early computers, such as the Commodore 64, Atari 800, and Apple II, all featured a disk operating
                system, including Commodore Business Machines DOS, Atari DOS, and Apple DOS, respectively. DOS/360 was
                an OS for IBM mainframes, which first appeared in 1966, but it is unrelated to the 8086-based DOS of the
                1980s.</li>

            <h3>How DOS works?</h3>
            <p>When a computer is powered on, it goes through various steps called <b>boot process</b>. For a computer
                running a disk operating system in the following six steps, such as:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The read-only memory (ROM) bootstrap loader reads the Master Boot Record and passes control over to
                    it.
                <li>The boot record loads the disk operating system into memory, and it takes control of the machine.
                </li>
                <li>The computer transfers data stored on a magnetic disk to its main memory, the random access memory
                </li>
                <li>It also transfers data to external devices attached to the computer, such as a computer screen or
                    printer.</li>
                <li>The computer provides various applications that organizes, read, and writes files on storage. The
                    files are organized in a hierarchical structure of directories, subdirectories, and files.</li>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>A disk operating system doesn't have a graphical user interface (GUI). Its interface is character-based,
                so users must type commands in the command line to indicate what actions they want.</p>

            <h3>Features of DOS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MS-DOS does not offer GUI (Graphical User Interface) and doesn't accept mouse inputs.
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is a character-based interface system where all commands are entered in the text at the
                            command-line prompt.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A disk operating system manages files, folders and allows program loading and execution. It can
                    control hardware devices such as disk, memory and allocate resources.</li>
                <li>MS-DOS offers a file system to organize, read and write files to disk storage.</li>
                <li>It is a single-user operating system and performs various taks to ensure the proper operation of
                    systems.</li>
                <li>It uses a 16-bit file allocation table (FAT16), and a 16-bit interface is used to define the
                    location of the memory of each file uniquely. These identifiers are stored in a tabular format with
                    the name File Allocation table.</li>
                <li>MS-DOS does not support a multiuser operating system, and it is less secure and does not have
                    concept of user roles.
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is very lightweight due to its basic interface and limited features.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limitations of MS-DOS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Built-in security &rarr; DOS does not have built-in security, such as file ownership and
                    permissions.</li>
                <li>No multiuser or multitasking &rarr; It also does not support multiuser or multitasking.
                    <ul>
                        <li>It can only run one program at a time, but it provides direct access to the basic I/O system
                            and underlying hardware.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h3>Types of DOS Commands</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The entire set of commands available in DOS is divided into two types</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="wh">
                <p>Internal Commands</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Internal commands are the simplest memory resident commands, most commonly used commands and execute immediately because they are a part of file named COMMAND.COM</li>
                    <li>When we list the files of our directory the internal commands are not seen.</li>
                    <li>Once DOS is loaded, there is not need for the DOS Diskette in a drive to use these commands. E.g. DIR, COPY, MOVE, etc.</li>
                    <li>If we execute internal command, the command processor executes the command itself.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="wh">
                <p>External Commands</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They are separate utility programs or files stored in DOS directory.</li>
                    <li>File name with an extension of .COM, .EXE or .BAT is considered as an external command.</li>
                    <li>They are faster than internal commands because they do not look for the COMMAND.COM file and are executed directly.</li>
                    <li>It does not execute the command itself but transfers the control to the appropriate program.</li>
                </ul>
