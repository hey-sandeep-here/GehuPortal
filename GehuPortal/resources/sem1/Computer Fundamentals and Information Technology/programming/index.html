                    and write.</li>
                <li>Programming language is made up of series of symbols that serves as a bridge that allow humans to

                    <p>The languages in this category are the Machine level language and Assembly language.</p>
                    <div class="in">
                        <p>Machine Level Language</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Computers can understand only digits signals, which are in binary digits i.e. 0 and 1.
                            </li>
                            <li>So the instructions given to the computer can be only in binary codes.</li>
                            <li>The machine language consists of instructions that are in binary 0 or 1.</li>
                            <li>Computers can understand only machine level language.</li>
                            <li>Writing a program in machine level language is a difficult task because it is not easy
                                for
                                programmers to write instructions in binary code.</li>
                            <li>A machine level language program is error-prone and its maintenance is very difficult.
                            </li>
                            <li>Furthermore machine language programs are not portable.</li>
                            <li>Every computer has its own machine instructions, so the programs written for one
                                computer
                                are not valid for other computers.</li>

                        <p>Assembly Language</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The difficulties faced in machine level language were reduced to some extent by using a
                                modified form of machine level language called assembly language.</li>
                            <li>In assembly language instructions are given in English like words, such as MOV, ADD, SUB
                                etc. So it is easier-to write and understand assembly programs.
                            </li>
                            <li>Since a computer can
                                understand
                                only machine level language, assembly language program must be translated into mahcine
                                language.</li>
                            <li>The translator that is used for translating is called 'assembler'.</li>
                            <li>Although writing programs in assembly language is a bit easier, the programmer has to
                                know
                                all the lower level details related with the hardware of a computer.</li>
                            <li>In assembly language, data is stored in computer registers and each computer has
                                diiferent
                                set of registers. Thus the assembly language program is also not portable.</li>
                            <li>Since the low level languages are related with the hardware, the execution of a
                                low-level
                                program is faster.</li>

                        <li>High level languages are designed keeping in mind the features of portability i.e. these
                            languages are machine independent.</li>
                        <li>These are English like languages, so it is easy to write and understand the programs of
                            high-level language.</li>
                        <li>While programming in a high level language, the programmer is not concerned with the low
                            level details, and so the whole attention can be paid to the logic of the problem being
                            solved.</li>
                        <li>For translating a high-level language program into machine language, compiler or interpreter
                            is used.</li>
                        <li>Every language has its own compiler or interpreter.</li>

                    <li>It consists of the use of a series of english-like words that humans can understand easily, to

                <h3>Fourth Generation Languages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The fourth-generation is also called a non-procedural language/ 4GL.</li>
                    <li>It enables user to access the database.</li>
                    <li>These languages are also human-friendly to understand.</li>
                    <li>4GLs are designed to reduce the overall time, effort and cost of software development.</li>

                        <li>It reduces overall cost, time, and effort.</li>
                        <li>A single line command can perform the task. On the other hand, in other languages, we need
                            to write a series of commands for the same task, in which syntax and keywords are not easily
                            understandable. </li>
                        <li>As databases are used everywhere to manage data so 4GL makes it very easy to create, manage
                            and operate the database.</li>
                        <li>It is very easy and simple to use even for beginners or end users.</li>
                        <li>Less time is required for application creation.</li>

                        <li>This is easy for users but in backend each query executes a sequence of commands which makes
                            it time consuming.</li>
                        <li>This language is only database oriented, which means we can use it for databases only.</li>
                        <li>Has poor control over Hardware.</li>
                        <li>Less flexible.</li>
