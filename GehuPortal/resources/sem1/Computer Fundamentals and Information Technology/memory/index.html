        <h1>Secondary Storage Devices</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>You know that processor or primary memory is very expensive and has limited storage capacity because of
                its volatile nature.</li>
            <li>If we need to store large amounts of data or programs permanently, we need a cheaper and permanent
                memroy.</li>
            <li><b>Secondary memory</b> overcomes this limitation by providing permanent storage of data in bulk
                quantity.</li>
            <li>A <b>secondary storage device</b> refers to any non-volatile storage device that is internal or external
                to the computer.</li>
            <li>It can be any storage device beyond the primary storage that enable permanent data storage.</li>
            <li>A secondary storage device is also known as an auxilary storage device, backup storage device, teir 2
                storage, or external storage.</li>
            <li>These devices store vitually all programs and applications on a computer, including the operating
                system, device drivers, applications and general user data.</li>
            <li>The secondary storage media can be <b>fixed or removable</b>.
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed storage media is an internal storage medium like a hard disk that is fixed inside the
                        computer.</li>
                    <li>A storage medium that is portable and can be taken outside the computer is termed removable
                        storage media.</li>
                    <li>The main advantage of using secondary storage devices is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In secondary storage devices, the stored data might not be under the direct control of
                                the operating system, For example, many organizations store their archival data or
                                ciritcal documents on secondary storage drives, which their main network cannot access
                                to ensure their preservation whenever a data breach occurs.</li>
                            <li>Since these drives do not interact directly with the main infrastructure and can be
                                situated in a remote or secure site, it is unlikely that a hacker may access these
                                drives unless they're physically stolen.</li>

            <h2>Why do we need Secondary Storage?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Computers use main memory such as RAM and cache to hold data that is being processed.</li>
                <li>However, this type of memory is volatile, and it loses its data when the computer is switched off.
                </li>
                <li>General-purpose computers, such as personal computers and tablets, need to store programs and data
                    for later use.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <ul>
                    <li>That's why secondary storage is needed to keep programs and data long term.</li>
                    <li>Secondary storage is non-volatile and able to keep data as long term storage.</li>
                    <li>They are used for various purposes such as backup data used for future restores or disaster
                        recovery, long-term archiving of data that is not frequently accessed, and storage of
                        non-critical data in lower-performing, less expensive drives.</li>

                    as :
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is non-volatile, which means it retains data when power is switched off</li>

                        <li>It is cheaper as compared to primary memory.</li>
                        <li>Secondary storage devices like CDs and flash drives can transfer the data from one device to

                <h3>1. Fixed Storage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed storage is an internal media device used by a computer system to store data. Usually,
                        these are referred to as the fixed disk drives or Hard Drives.</li>
                    <li>Fixed storage devices are not fixed. These can be removed from the system for reparing work,
                        maintenance purposes, and also for an upgrade, etc. But in general, this can not be done without
                        a proper toolit to open up the computer system to provide physical access, which needs to be
                        done by an engineer.</li>
                    <li>Technically, almost all data, i.e. being processed on a computer system, is stored on some
                        built-in fixed storage device. We have the following types of fixed storage:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Internal flash memory (rare)</li>

                    <li>Removable storage is an external media device that is used by a computer system to store data.
                    </li>
                    <li>Usually, these are referred to as the Removable Disks drives or the External Drives.</li>
                    <li>Removalble storage is any storage device than can be removed from a computer system while the
                        system is running.</li>
                    <li>Examples of external devices include CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray disk drives, and diskettes and USB
                        drives.</li>
                    <li>Removable storage makes it easier for a user to transfer data from one computer system to
                        another.</li>
                    <li>The main benefir of removable disks in storage factors is that they can provide the fast
                        transfer rates associated with storage area networks (SANs).</li>
