        <ul>
            <li>Digital computers store and process information in binary form as digital logic has only two values "1"
                and "0" or in other words "True or False".</li>
            <li>This system is called radix 2.</li>
            <li>We human generally deal with radix 10 i.e. decimal.</li>
            <li>As matter of convenience there are many other representations like Octal (Radix 8), Hexadecimal (Radix
                16), Binary coded decimal (BCD), Decimal etc.</li>
            <li>Every computer's CPU has a width measured in terms of bits such as 8 bit CPU, 16 bit CPU, 32 bit CPU
                etc. </li>
            <li>Similarly, each memory location can store a fixed number of bits and is called memory width.</li>
            <li>Given the size of the CPU and Memory, it is for the programmer to handle his data representation.</li>

            <h2>Data Representation in Computers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Information handled by a computer is classified as intruction and data.</li>

                <li>No matter whether data is in numeric or non-numeric form or integer, everything is internally
                    represented in Binary.</li>
                <li>It is up to the programmer to handle the interpretation of the binary pattern and this
                    interpretation is called <i>Data Representation</i> </li>
                <li>Choice of Data representation to be used in a computer is decided by
                    <ul>
                        <li>The number types to be represented (integer, real, signed, unsigned, etc)</li>
                        <li>Range of vlaues likely to be represented (maximum and minimum to be represented)</li>
                        <li>The precision of the numbers i.e. maximum accuracy of representation (floating point single

                        <li>If non-numeric i.e. character, character representation standard to be chose.

                                <li>ASCII, EBCDIC, UTF are examples of character representation standards.</li>

                <h3>Integer Representation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The number of bits used in representing the integer also implies the maximum number that can be
                        represented in the system hardware.</li>
                    <li>However for the efficiency of storage and operations, one may choose to represent the integer
                        with one Byte, two Bytes, Four bytes or more.</li>
                    <li>This space allocation is translated from the definition used by the programmer while defining a
                        variable as integer short or long and the Instruction Set Architecture.</li>
                    <li>In addition to the bit length definition for integers, we also have a choice to represent them
                        as below:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Unsigned Integer</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>A positive number including zero can be represented in this format.</li>
                                    <li>All the alloted bits are utilised in defining the number.</li>
                                    <li>So if one is using 8 bits to represent the unsigned integer, the range of values
                                        that can be represented is 28 i.e. "0" to "255".</li>
                                    <li>If 16 bits are used for representing then the range is 216 i.e. "0 to 65535".
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Signed Integer</b>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In this format negative numbers, zero and positive numbers can be prepresented.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>A sign bit indicates the magnitude direction as positive or negative.</li>
                                    <li>There are three posibble representations signed integer and these are <b>Sign
                                            Magitude format, 1's Compliment format and 2's Compliment format.</b></li>

                        <li>Although this method is easy to understand, Sign Magnitude representation has several

                                <li>The separate sign bit makes the addition and subtraction more complicated. Also
                                    comparing two numbers is not straigt forward.</li>

                    <li>Hence we write such large or small numbers using exponent and mantissa.</li>
                    <li>This is said to be Floating Point representation or real number representation.</li>

                            <li>Unlike the two's compliment representation for integer numbers, Floating Point number uses Sign and Magnitude representation for both <i>mantissa and exponent,</i></li>
