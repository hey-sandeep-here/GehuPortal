            <h2>Introduction to firewall</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A firewall is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects or drops that specific traffic.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accept &rarr; allow the traffic</li>
                        <li>Reject &rarr; block the traffic but reply with an 'unreachable error'</li>
                        <li>Drop &rarr; block the traffic with no reply</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A firewall establishes a barrier between secured internal networks and outside untrusted network, such as the internet.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>How firewall works</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Firewall match the network traffic against the rule set defined in its table.</li>
                    <li>Once the rule is matched, associated action is applied to the network traffic.</li>
                    <li>For example &rarr; Rules are defined as any employee from HR department cannot access the data from code server and at the same time another rule is defined like system administrator can access the data from both HR and technical depatment.</li>
                    <li>Rules can ve defined on the firewall based on the necessity and security policies of the organization.</li>
