            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>In simple words, communication is the activity of transferring information from one person to the
                    other through a medium. It is obvious that transfer of information will involve at least two
                    persons, a sender and a receiver. One person alone cannot transfer information. However, an
                    individual can convey information to many persons through various means.</li>
                <li>Communication involves giving, receiving or exchanging of any information, in the form of ideas,
                    data,
                    images, signals or messages through appropriate media.</li>
                <li>It is derived from the latin word 'communis' that means to share.</li>
                <li>According to definition provided by William H. Newman and Charles E. Summer <b>"Communication is the
                        exchange of ideas, facts, opinions, or emotions of two or more people."</b></li>
                <li>Communication is a two-way dynamic process in which the senders and the receivers are continuously
                    interacting to facilitate exchange of ideas, thoughts, feeling, data and other information.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Effective communication</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The basic objective of every communication is to arrive at a common understanding through the
                        process of transformation of information.</li>
                    <li>Thus, the process of communication is not completed merely by passing a message from one person
                        (the sender) to the other person (the receiver).</li>
                    <li>The communication is completed only after the message is understood by the receiver, as intented
                        by the sender.</li>
                    <li>It is important for the sender to get continous feedback from the receiver to ascertain that the
                        message is understood as intended and avoid breakdown of communication. Thus, effective
                        communication involves continuous two-way flow of information between sender and receiver.</li>
                    <li>Effective communication among employees in the organization creates strong bonding which in turn
                        helps to improve teamwork, besides enhancing the ability to address and solve problems and take
                        prompt decisions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Purpose of communication</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The purpose of communication is important, as whenever we interact with another person there is
                        some objective to be achieved.</li>
                    <li>Even routine conversation on social media platforms has an objective to maintain contact with
                        friends.</li>
                    <li>Similarly, every communication has a specific purpose.
                        <ul>
                            <li>For example, a marketing professional communicates to convince and persuade the
                                customers to buy products. </li>
                            <li>A manager communicates to inform his team about the targets to be achieved during the
                                month or year.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Communication process</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communication process is not the same as communication.</li>
                    <li>It is a structured method to transmit messages from the sender to the receiver through a
                        suitable channel of transmission.</li>
                    <li>The process of communication is not completed with the passage of message to the receiver, the
                        message must be understood by the receiver as intended by the sender.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/commun.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <p>The entire process involves a number of steps starting from the sender of the message and ending with
                    receiver sending back the feedback.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Sender : </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The communication process begins from the person who transmits message.</li>
                            <li>The sender is the initiator of the message.</li>
                            <li>The idea, thought, information, report or whatever message is to be send has to be first
                                encoded by the sender.</li>
                            <li>Further, it has to be ensured by the sender that the message is encoded in a manner that
                                the receiver easily understands it.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Message :</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is the content, information, data, report and any other material, that has to be
                                delivered to the receiver to as the information conveyed by words as in speech and
                                write-ups, signs, pictures or symbols depending upon the situation and the nature and
                                importance of information desierd to be sent.</li>
                            <li>Message is the most important part of communication.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Encoding :</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The sender has to encode the message in a manner that the target group of people is able
                                to understand.</li>
                            <li>Precise encoding is a prerequisite for effective communication.</li>
                            <li>Improper or incorrect encoding may lead to serious communication errors and defeat its
                                very purpose.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>After, encoding, the sender choses a suitable medium for the transmission of the message
                                depending on the purpose and context.</li>
                            <li>The medium can be in the form of print, electronic, digital or sound.</li>
                            <li>It may be oral or written and transmitted through telephone, telegraph or a mass medium
                                like radio or television.</li>
                            <li>The message is conveyed through the channel, which connects the sender and the receiver.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>As soon as message reaches the receiver through the channel the, process of decoding
                                begins to convert and interpret it into an intelligible form.</li>
                            <li>Decoding essentially means the process through which the receiver comprehends the
                                message.</li>
                            <li>The receiver tries to understand the message through decoding.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li><b>Receiver :</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Communication is effective only if the receiver is able to understand the message as
                                intended by the sender.</li>
                            <li>Just like sender, receiver is important as the end target.</li>
                            <li>Communication is successful only if the receiver comprehends the message as intended.
                            </li>
                            <li>In case the receiver is distracted, inattentive, preoccupied with thoughts the
                                communication will fail. The possibility of miscommunication is high in such situations
                                for which noise may be responsible.</li>

                                understood as intended or not.</li>
                            <li>It is the response of the receiver to the sender, with which the cycle of communication
