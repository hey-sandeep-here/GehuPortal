                    One great defect of our civilization is that it does not know what to do with
                    its knowledge. Science, as we have seen, has given us powers fit for the gods, yet we use them like
                    small children. For example: - we do not know how to manage our machines. Machines were made to be
                    man's servants; yet he has grown so dependent on them that they are in a fair way to become his
                    masters. Already most men spend most of their lives looking after and waiting upon machines. And the
                    machines are very stern masters. They must be fed with coal, and given petrol to drink, and oil to
                    wash with, and must be kept at the right temperature. And if they do not get their meals when they
                    expect them, they grow sulky and refuse to work, or burst with rage, and blow up, and spread ruin
                    and destruction all round them, So we have to wait upon them very attentively and do all that we can
                    to keep them In a good temper. Already we find it difficult either to work or play without the
                    machines, and a time may come when they will rule us altogether, just as we rule the animals.

                    We do not know what to do with our knowledge. Science has given us superhuman powers, which we do
                    not use properly. For example, we are unable to manage our machines. Machines should be fed promptly
                    and waited upon attentively; otherwise, they refuse to work or cause destruction. We already find it
                    difficult to do without machines. Over time they may rule over us all together. (66 WORDS)</p>

                <h3>Q- Write a dialogue between a student and a teacher. The student has just given exams of 10th board
                    and waiting for results to come. </h3>
                <p>
                    Teacher: What are you planning to do after passing your 10th board?
                    <br> Student: Sir, it would totally depend on the marks I get.
                    <br> Teacher: Aha! Have you set up any criteria based on the marks?
                    <br> Student: Yes Sir, I will select the Science stream if I get more than 80%. In case if I secure
                    more than 60%, I will select Commerce and the last option is Arts which is less likely to happen.
                    <br> Teacher: So, you will be choosing your future based on the traditional way. But let me tell
                    you, you are going in the wrong direction.
                    <br> Student: Oh! But why sir, This is the usual way in which anyone selects the stream. In fact, my
                    dad is forcing me to secure good grades. So, I can select the Science stream.
                    <br> Teacher: Yes, you are correct in this regard that it is the traditional way of thinking. But
                    things have changed a lot nowadays.
                    <br> Student: How Sir, we have been hearing all this time that based on the marks you should select
                    your career path. All my friends are also going to select the stream in
                    this way only. Please explain to me your thoughts in more depth.
                    <br> Teacher: The most important thing that I would suggest is, stop following your friends and
                    don't come under any pressure from family. You choose the stream which you are most passionate about
                    rather than doing what your friends are doing or parents are saying or merely on the marks. There
                    are a plethora of career options after 10th. I have a reference of a career guide. Please do consult
                    with him
                    to clarify all your doubts.
                    <br> Student: Sir, you have pushed my thought process in an opposite and correct direction. I am
                    suffering from the points that you have just mentioned. I will definitely contact the Sir whose
                    reference you will give and try to clarify my doubts. Thanks a lot for helping me out, Sir
