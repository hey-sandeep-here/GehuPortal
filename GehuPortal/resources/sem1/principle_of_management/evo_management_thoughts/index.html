            <ul>
                <li>Concept of scientific management was introduced by F.W Taylor (Frederick Winslow Taylor)</li>
                <li>Born in 1856
                    <br>Chief Engineer in 1884 at Midvale Steel Works.
                    <br>Father of Scientific Management.
                </li>
                <li>Scientific Management is concerned with knowing exactly what we want our men to do and then see it
                    that they do it in the best and cheapest way.</li>

                <h3>Principles of Scientific Management</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Science, Not rule of thumb :-
                        <ul>
                            <li>This involves use of scientific methods in place of rule of thumb which involves trial &
                                error methods which is a costly method.</li>
                            <li>Where as scientific methods involves investigation of work methods by work study and
                                finding best practices and developing standard method which can be followed in an
                                organization.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Harmony not Discord(conflict) -
                        <ul>
                            <li>It means or focuses on maintaining harmony (good relations) between workers and
                                management rather than conflicts, both must realize that they require support of each
                                other.</li>
                            <li>Management should share profits with workers and workers should work hard with loyalty
                                and must accept the changes for betterment of the organization.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Cooperation not Individualism -
                        <ul>
                            <li>It explains that cooperation feeling must be there between management & workers instead
                                of individualism.</li>
                            <li>Management must take suggestions of workers in doing task and while taking important
                                decision which affect workers, and there should be equal division of workers and
                                responsibility between workers and management.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Development of each and every employee -
                        <ul>
                            <li>This principle involves development of each and every worker to its greatest efficiency.
                            </li>
                            <li>Development of workers require proper training and development of workers at workplace
                                to keep them fully fit according to new methods of working.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Taylor has proposed functional foremanship technique for supervising workers.</li>
                            <li>It is a technique which involves supervision of each worker by 8 supervisors, out of
                                which 4 are from planning department and 4 are from production department.</li>

                            <li>It refers to setting standards for every activity to maximize output and make work task

                        <ul>
                            <li>It refers to systematic, objective & critical evaluation of work with the aim of
                                indentifying how work can be done in the best way.</li>
                            <li>In work study, 4 types of studies are undertaken -

                    <li>Differential Piece wage system -
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is a wage payment system in which a worker who achieves or exceeds production target
                                gets wage at higher price per piece, while a worker who does not achieve target gets
                                wage at lower rate per piece.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Authority means power to take decisions and responsibility means to complete the job
                                assigned on time under the guidance of upper management.</li>
                            <li>There should be a
                                balance between authority and responsibility. Mere responsibility without authority
                                makes
                                an executive less interested in discharging duties. Similarly, giving authority without
                                assigning responsibility makes him arrogant and there is fear of misuse of power.</li>

                                it will create confusion, conflict, disturbance and overlapping activities.</li>

                                ensures unity of action and coordination.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The overall pay and compensation should be, fair to both
                                employees and the organization. The employees should be given fair wages so that they
                                can have
                                a reasonable standard of living. Wages should be within the paying capacity of the
                                organisation.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The interest of an organization should take priority over the interest of any individual
                                employee. In simple words the organisation interest to be prioritiezed over individual
                                interest.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Centralization means concentration of decisions making authority in few hands at top
                                level, whereas distribution of power at every level of management is decentralization.
                                Both should be balanced as no organization can be completely centralized or completely
                                decentralized.</li>

                                lowest ranks is known as scalar chain. This chain should not be violated but in
