                <ul>
                    <li>After the identification of need for the number and type of personnel as indicated by human
                        resource planning and job analysis, the next step is to acquire these personnel.</li>
                    <li>This involves location of such personnel, motivating them to offer themselves for consideration
                        for selection, and selecting the personnel who fit with job requirements</li>
                    <li>The whole process is known as recruitment and selection. Recruitment and selection, though
                        differ in terms of process and orientation, are often used together because these are closely
                        related.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Recruitment is the process concerned with the identification of sources from where the
                            personnel can be employed and motivating them to offer themselves for employment.</li>
                        <li>Thus, recruitment process is concerned with the identification of possible sources of human
                            resource supply and tapping those sources. </li>
                        <li>. In the total process of acquiring and placing human resources in the organization,
                            recruitment falls in between different sub-processes as shown in Figure &darr; </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>There are various sources of recruitment which are grouped into two categories: internal
                            sources and external sources. Within each category, there are different sources.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="in">
                        <p>Internal sources of recruitment</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Filling organizational positions through internal sources is rearrangement of the
                                existing employees as there is no increase in number of employees. There are two ways in
                                which internal sources may be used: transfer and promotion:</li>
                            <li>Transfer &rarr; Transfer involves shifting an employee from one department to another or
                                from one place to another without changing his nature of job. Transfer is a very common
                                practice in government administration. In business organizations, transfer is used to
                                rationalize workforce by transferring surplus employees of one unit/department to
                                another having shortage of employees or transferring employees from one function to
                                another to develop multi-skills.</li>
                            <li>Promotion &rarr; Promotion involves upward movement of an employee in organizational
                                hierarchy. In this case, there is change in job contents of the employee-more authority
                                and responsibility, more compensation, and higher status. Promotion is very common in
                                organizations. It leads to motivation to employees and they put hard work for getting
                                promotion. It serves the organizational need of having competent persons at higher
                                positions who are well-versed with organizational functioning.</li>
                            <li>There are certain advantages of recruitment from internal sources which are as follows:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Filling higher positions through internal sources is motivating to employees as
                                        they have chance for promotion.</li>
                                    <li>It leads to loyalty of employees towards the organization because of their long
                                        stay.</li>
                                    <li>It is quite simple and economical.</li>
                                    <li>It reduces employee development cost because the same employee works elsewhere
                                        with same set of skills.</li>
                                    <li>It helps in workforce rationalization.</li>
                                    <li>It is helpful in developing multi-skills in employ</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Disadvantages of recruitment from internal sources are as follows:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>It leads to in-breeding which may block creativity relevant for working in
                                        innovative
                                        way.</li>
                                    It leads to eliminate competitive spirit among employees.
                                    <li>It tends to reduce productivity of employees because of assured promotion.</li>
                                </ol>

                    <div class="in">
                        <p>External Sources of Recruitment</p>
                        <p>In external sources of recruitment, employees are selected from outside the organization.
                            These sources are as follows:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Advertisement &rarr; Advertisement is the most commonly used source of external
                                recruitment. Advertisement may be through newspapers (the most common) and technical
                                publications. Details of positions and their requirements along with how to apply are
                                mentioned in the advertisement.</li>
                            <li> Campus Recruitment &rarr; In this, employing organizations visit campuses of various
                                academic institutions offering relevant course on pre-specified time and date. The
                                entire selection process is performed at the campus itself.</li>
                            <li>Job Fairs &rarr; In one way, a job fair is a kind of variant of campus recruitment. In a
                                job fair, various academic institutions located in a large city jointly organize
                                recruitment programme. In this programme, candidates of different institutes, even from
                                non-organizing institutes, come by paying the prescribed fee. Organizations visit the
                                fair by invitation. The selection process takes place like campus recruitment. </li>
                            <li>Internet Recruiting &rarr; It is an electronic mode of external recruitment devoid of
                                any paper work. In this mode, two alternatives are followed. First, the organization
                                notifies its vacancies on its website along with other details. Candidates apply in
                                response to this notification. Second, many job seekers post their biodata on different
                                websites and an organization may contact suitable candidates from them. It is the
                                quickest way of recruiting with much lower cost.</li>
                            <li>Placement Agencies &rarr; In many cases, organizations do not take recruitment and
                                selection process on their own but take the services of placement agencies. These
                                agencies maintain the database of job seekers. They conduct the entire selection process
                                and recommend the candidates to be employed by an organization. This frees the
                                organization from undertaking time-consuming recruitment and selection process. Through
                                this method, positions at any level may be filled.</li>
                            <li> Employment Exchanges &rarr; Government has established employment exchanges in most of
                                the cities. These exchanges register job seekers. Whenever an organization sends its
                                requirement of employees, these exchanges inform the job seekers concerned and provide
                                their list to the organization. Rest of the process is conducted by the organization.
                                This is suitable for filling positions at lower levels.</li>
                            <li>Employee Recommendations &rarr; Present and former employees of an organization may
                                recommend specific persons suitable for employment. These persons may be family members,
                                friends or acquaintances of the employees concerned. Since the employees are fully
                                conversant with the way of working of the organization, their recommendations may be
                                more suitable. Generally, lower positions are filled by this method though in
                                exceptional cases, higher positions may also be filled.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <ul>
                            <li>PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF MANAGEMENT
                                Recruitment from external sources has various advantages which are as follows:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>It leads to attracting competent persons to apply for the jobs.</li>
                                    <li>There is wide scope for selecting the suitable candidates.</li>
                                    <li>It helps in infusing new talents in the organization.</li>
                                    <li>It leads to development of competitive spirit in the existing employees for
                                        getting higher positions.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Disadvantages of recruitment from external sources are as follows:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>It leads to dissatisfaction of employees as their promotion chances are reduced,
                                    </li>
                                    <li>It is quite lengthy process taking lot of time of persons involved in
                                        recruitment and selection.</li>
                                    <li>It results in higher cost of recruitment and selection.</li>
                                    <li>It may disrupt organizational practices because the new employees may have their
                                        own specific work practices.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                <div class="wh">
                    <p>Selection</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Selection is the process of choosing the most suitable candidates out of the several
                            candidates available.</li>
                        <li>Selection is called a negative process because there may be more candidates who are rejected
                            than those who are selected in most of the selection processes.</li>
                        <li>Recruitment and selection differ in terms of objective, process, technique, and outcome,
                            which are as follows:
                            <ol>
                                <li>The ultimate objectives of both recruitment and selection are to acquire suitable
                                    candidates but their immediate objectives differ. The basic objective of recruitment
                                    is to attract maximum number of candidates so that more options are available. The
                                    basic objective of selection is to choose the best out of the available candidates.
                                </li>
                                <li>Recruitment differs from selection in terms of process. Recruitment adopts the
                                    process of creating application pool as large as possible and, therefore, it is
                                    known as positive process. Selection adopts the process through which more and more
                                    candidates are rejected and fewer candidates are selected or sometimes even not a
                                    single candidate is selected. Therefore, it is known as negative process or
                                    rejection process. </li>
                                <li>There is difference between recruitment and selection so far as techniques involved
                                    are concerned. Recruitment techniques are not very intensive, requiring high skills.
                                    As against this, in selection process, highly specialized techniques are required.
                                    Therefore, in the selection process, only personnel with specific skills like
                                    expertise in using selection tests, conducting interviews, etc., are involved</li>

                                their personal bio- data, achievements, experience, etc. Such information is used to
                                screen the applicants who are found to be qualified for the consideration of employment.
                                Based on the screening of applications, only those candidates are called for further

                            <li>Selection Tests &rarr; Many organizations hold different kinds of selection tests to
                                know more about the candidates or to reject the candidates who cannot be called for
                                interview, etc. Selection tests normally supplement the information provided in the
                                application forms by giving information about aptitude, interest, personality, etc. of
                                the candidates which cannot be known by application forms.</li>
                            <li> Checking of References &rarr; Many organizations ask the candidates to provide the
                                names of referees from whom more information about the candidates can be solicited. Such
                                information may be related to character, working, etc. The usual referees may be
                                previous employers, persons associated with the educational institutions from where the
                                candidates have received education, or other persons of prominence who may be aware of
                                the candidates' behaviour and ability. </li>
                            <li>Physical Examination &rarr; Physical examination is carried out to ascertain the
                                physical standards and fitness of prospective employees. The practice of physical
                                examination varies a great deal both in terms of coverage and timing. While many
                                organizations do not carry physical examinations at all, others carry on a very
                                comprehensive basis. Some organizations only have general check up of applicants to find
                                the major physical problems which may come in the way of effective discharge of duties.
                                In the context of timing also, there are different practices: some organizations conduct
                                physical examination near the end of the selection process; others conduct it relatively
                                early in the process. The latter practice is generally adopted when there is high demand
                                for physical fitness. </li>
                            <li>Selection of Candidates &rarr; On the basis of the above steps, suitable candidates are
                                selected for employment. In some cases, the selection committee is not empowered to
                                select candidates finally but it has authority only for recommending the names of the
                                candidates selected by it for approval of appropriate authority.</li>
                            <li>Approval by Authority &rarr; Organizations may designate the various authorities for
                                approval of final selection of candidates for different categories of candidates. Thus,
                                for top level managers, Board of Directors may be approving authority; for lower levels,
                                even functional heads concerned may be approving authority. In university, it may be
                                syndicate/ executive committee. When the approval is received, the candidates are
                                informed about their selection.</li>
                            <li> Employment Contract &rarr; Relationship between an organization and its employees is
                                contractual. Therefore, every new recruit has to enter a contract with the organization.
                                Along with appointment letter specifying when and where to join the organization, every
                                new recruit is sent an agreement form specifying the terms and conditions of employment.
                                With this, the selection process for filling positions at a time is over.</li>
