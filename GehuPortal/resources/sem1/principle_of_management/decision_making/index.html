            <h3>Techniques or basis of decision making</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Intuition - decision making by intuition is characterized by inner feeling of the person. He takes a
                    decision as per the dictates of his conscious.</li>
                <li>FACTS - It is considered to be the best basis of decisions making. Such decisions will be sound and
                    proper.</li>
                <li>Experience - Past experience of a person
                    becomes a good basis for taking decisions. When a similar situation arises the manager can rely on
                    his past decisions and takes similar decisions.
                </li>
                <li>Operations research - It helps managers by providing scientific basis for solving organized problems
                    involving interaction of components of the organization.</li>
                <li>Values - Being confused and unclear about one‘s values may affect decision- making ability.
                    Overcoming a lack of self- awareness through values clarification decreases confusion.</li>
                <li>Individual Preference - Overcoming this area of vulnerability, involves self- awareness, honesty and
                    risk taking.</li>

                    <li>Here three things get together</li>
                    <li>Decision making - it is purposeful and goal directed effort using a systematic process to choose
                        among options. The hallmark of decision making is the identification and selection of options.
                    </li>
                    <li>Problem solving - problem solving is focused on trying to solve an immediate problem</li>
                    <li>Creativity - It is essential for generation of options or solutions. Creative individuals are
                        able to conceptualize new and innovated approaches to a problem by being more flexible and
                        independent in their thinking.</li>
