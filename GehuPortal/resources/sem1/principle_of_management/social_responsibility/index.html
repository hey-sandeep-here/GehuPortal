                base.</li>

            <h2>Benefits of social responsibility management</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved community: By implementing social responsibility management in your management style, you
                    can improve your community. This can be through improving the environment, strengthening
                    relationships and heightening voices.</li>
                <li>Boosted image: Investing in social responsibility management can supply the marketing team with
                    additional materials and focus for commercials and advertisements. This can give the brand a boosted
                    image in the press and in the public.</li>
                <li>Increased customer base: You may be more likely to attract customers with positive outlooks and
                    associations with your brand when you implement social responsibility management. Consumers can act
                    as additional marketing for the brand by talking to others about the products, services and social
                    ideals the company holds.</li>

                    responsibility management can help them improve their knowledge and strengthen their skills. For
                    example, when managers learn to prioritize the community in decision-making, they also learn to
                    prioritize members of their team.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of social responsibility</h2>
            <p>As a manager, you can create a social responsibility management plan that includes a single focus or
                encompasses many responsibilities to the community. These are the different types of social

                        <li>This can include steps like using recycled materials during manufacturing, offsetting the
                            carbon footprint of shipping or donating to organizations that support the environment.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Ethical: a company's ethical responsibility refers to its efforts that all team members and
                    customers receive respect and fair treatment. This includes suppliers, investors and leadership

                    resources in a way that positively impacts the community. This can include sourcing materials and
