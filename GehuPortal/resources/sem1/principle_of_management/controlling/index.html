            <li>Controlling is a process that entails comparing actual performance to the desired outcome, so as to
                ensure the successful achievement of objectives. Setting standards, measuring actual performance, and
                taking corrective action in case of deviations are all part of the managerial role of controlling

                <ul>
                    <li>An effective control system allows management to determine if the standards set are accurate or
                        not by closely monitoring changes in the organization's environment.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>An effective control system guarantees that staff are aware of what they are expected to do as
                        well as the performance requirements. As a result, it inspires and assists them in delivering
                        superior results.</li>

                    <li>By maintaining a careful eye on the activities of its employees, the controlling function
                        generates an atmosphere of order and discipline in the firm.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The last and most crucial role of controlling is to ensure that each department and employee is
                        governed by predetermined standards and goals that are well-understood and coordinated. This
                        guarantees that the organization's overall goals are met in a timely way.</li>

            <h2>Limitations of controlling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Difficulty in seting quatitative standards: When standards cannot be measured, a control system
                    loses some of its effectiveness.</li>
                <li>2. Little control on external factors: External elements such as government legislation, technical
                    advancements, and competition, among others, are beyond the control of an organization.</li>
                <li>3. Resistance from employees: Employees, for the most part, despise being controlled by their bosses
                    and they dislike being in constant vigilance of the management.</li>
                <li>4. Costly affair: Control is an expensive procedure because it necessitates a lot of money, time,
                    and effort in terms of setting standards, measuring performance and correcting the deviations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Features of Controlling</h2>
            <p>In an organization, control is a major goal-oriented function of management. It is a process of comparing
                actual performance to the company's defined standards to ensure that actions are carried out according
                to the plans, and if they aren't, corrective action is taken.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Goal oriented: The attainment of defined goals or organization whether it is profit making,
                    non-profit making, business or non-business, at all levels whether it is top level management or
                    middle level management or lower-level managment.</li>
                <li>Pervasive: Controlling is required in all types of organization whether it is profit making,
                    non-profit making, business or non-business, at all levels whether it is top level management or
                    middle level management or lower-level management.</li>
                <li>Continuous: Continuous performance development, is a real-time, forward-looking approach to
                    performance that businesses utilise to align and grow their people while assisting them in their
                    success.</li>
                <li>Controlling is the process of reviewing staff performance: Through controlling function, the
                    management can keep a check on the performance, dedication, and problem areas of the staff.</li>
                <li>It is a forward-looking function: Controlling is a forward looking function, as it helps in deciding
                    the future course of action in case the actual performance does not match with the standards set.
                </li>
                <li>It is dependent on the planning: Controlling is dependent on the planning function, as the
                    comparison of actual performance is made with the planned performance. Hence planning acts as a base
                    for controlling.</li>
                <li>Action oriented: The focus of management is on accomplishing the work with the help of human
                    resources. It is the effective and efficient coordination of all available resources. The actions in
                    an organisation are carried out by subordinates, or workers, who work under the supervision of a
                    manager.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Relationship between planning and controlling</h2>
            <p>Planning and controlling are intertwinned and mutually reinforcing in the sense that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Planning is required for effective control. The norm for controlling is set by plans. Managers have
                    no influence over anything if the standards aren't defined ahead of time.</li>
                <li>Without controlling, planning is worthless. When control is exercised, it is fruitful. It detects
                    any deviations and takes corrective action if necessary.</li>
                <li>Controlling assesses the efficiency of planning and aids in the implementation of remedial actions.
                </li>
                <li>Planning is forward-thinking, whereas controlling is backward-thinking. Planning is a
                    future-oriented activity since it entails thinking ahead and establishing policies to maximize
                    resource use in the future, which is why it is referred to as a forward-looking function. </li>
                <li>In controlling, we examine the employees' previous performance and compare it to the established
                    requirements. If there are any discrepancies between real and expected performance or output, the
                    controlling functions ensure that future actual performance meets expected performance. As a result,
                    controlling is a function that looks ahead.</li>
                <li>As a result, planning and controlling are intertwined, and they walk hand in hand. Controlling
                    becomes more successful because of planning, whereas planning enhances future controlling.</li>

                    <li>The criteria against which actual performance can be measured are known as standards</li>
                    <li> Standards are the goals that an organisation aspires to achieve.</li>
                    <li>Due to changes in the business environment, standards should be flexible enough to be adjusted
                        as needed. </li>
                    <li>Standards could be qualitative or quantitative or it could also be time bound or cost bound.

                    <li>Performance standards are established first, and then actual performance is assessed.</li>
                    <li>Personal observation and sample checking should be used to measure performance in an objective
                        and reliable manner.</li>
                    <li>Performance should be measured in the same terms that standards have been defined to make
                        comparisions easier.</li>
                    <li>Performance can be checked simultaneously when the work is being performed or after the
                        completion of work.</li>

                    <li>Critical point control: control should be focused on key result areas (KRAs) that are cruicial

                    <li>Management by Exception: Exceptional management Control by exception, often known as control by
                        exception, is a key management control philosophy based on the belief that attempting to control
                        everything leads to managing nothing. In other words, you can't control everything at the same
                        time. </li>

                <h3>Taking corrective action</h3>
                <p>Taking remedial action is the final step in controlling process. When the variance is within
                    acceptable bounds, no corrective action is necessary. When major aberrations occur, however,
                    corrective action is required like:</p>

                    <li>Work processes are being updated.</li>
                    <li>In case of overestemation or underestimation of standards, the standards are set again.</li>
