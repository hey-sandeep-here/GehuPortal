                <h3>Basic Steps Followed by Microprocessor</h3>
                <p>Before executing any instruction, the microprocessor needs to know where to find the data or
                    operation to be performed. This step involves determining the memory location or register
                    address of the instruction to be processed.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Fetch:</strong></li>
                    <p>Once the address is determined, the microprocessor fetches the instruction from the specified
                        memory location. This involves retrieving the binary code representing the instruction and
                        bringing it into the processor's memory for further processing.</p>

                    <li><strong>Decode:</strong></li>
                    <p>After fetching the instruction, the microprocessor decodes the binary code. This step involves
                        interpreting the instruction to understand what operation needs to be performed and which data
                        is involved. The microprocessor determines the specific sequence of actions required for
                        execution.</p>

                    <li><strong>Execute:</strong></li>
                    <p>With the instruction decoded, the microprocessor performs the actual operation or manipulates the
                        data according to the instruction's requirements. This step completes the execution cycle, and
                        the result may be stored back in memory or sent to other components for further processing.</p>

                <li><strong>Addressability:</strong> The unit of addressability, often expressed in bits, indicates the
                    smallest addressable storage unit. For example, if the addressability is 8 bits, each address points
                    to a byte of memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Formula:</strong> The addressable memory space (N) can be calculated using the formula N =
                    2<sup>(Address Bus Width)</sup>.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Example:</strong>
                <br>
                If a computer system has a 16-bit address bus, the addressable memory space would be 2^16, resulting in
                64 kilobytes (KB) of addressable memory.

                <li>When an instruction is fetched from memory, it is stored in the instruction register (IR). The
                    instruction decoder then interprets this opcode to determine the operation to be performed.</li>
                <li>The instruction decoder communicates the operation details to the timing and control unit, which
                    generates the necessary control signals to execute the instructions.</li>
                <li>For arithmetic and logical operations, one operand is typically fetched from the accumulator (A),
                    while the other operand is fetched from a temporary register (Temp Register) by the Arithmetic Logic
                    Unit (ALU). The ALU processes this data, and the result is usually stored back in the accumulator,
                    affecting the status flags based on the ALU outcome.</li>
                <li>For example, consider the instruction ADI 45H. The opcode ADI is fetched into the instruction
                    register and decoded by the instruction decoder. Subsequently, the timing and control unit generates
                    a signal to fetch the next byte of the instruction, which in this case is the data value 45H. This
                    data is then loaded into the temporary register for processing by the ALU, and the result is stored
                    back in the accumulator.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vcc (Voltage at the Common Collector):</strong> Provides power to the microprocessor,
                        like a battery supplying electricity. It's usually connected to a positive voltage source, such
                        as +5V.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vss (Voltage at the Source):</strong> The ground reference for the microprocessor,
                        acting like the negative terminal of a battery. It's typically connected to 0V or ground.</li>

                    <li><strong>X1 and X2:</strong> Crystal oscillator connections used to provide the microprocessor
                        with a clock signal for timing operations. They are often connected to an external crystal
                        oscillator or a clock generator circuit.</li>

                    <li><strong>CLK(OUT) (Clock Output):</strong> The output pin for the clock signal generated by the
                        microprocessor. It provides a synchronized clock signal that other components can use for timing
                        their operations.</li>

                <h3><u style="text-decoration: overline;">RESET IN</u> and RESET OUT</h3>
                <p>RESET IN and RESET OUT pins play a crucial role in managing the microprocessor's state.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong><u style="text-decoration: overline;">RESET IN</u>:</strong> Initiates a reset operation
                        when triggered. For instance, if there's a system error or malfunction, RESET IN helps restart
                        the microprocessor to restore normal operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>RESET OUT:</strong> Signals to external devices that a reset operation is ongoing. For
                        example, when the microprocessor resets, RESET OUT informs connected devices to prepare for the
                        reset and adjust their operations accordingly.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SID (Serial Input Data):</strong> Receives data from an external device, such as a
                        keyboard or sensor, and sends it to the microprocessor. For example, when you press a key on
                        your keyboard, the SID pin receives the corresponding data and sends it to the microprocessor
                        for processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>SOD (Serial Output Data):</strong> Sends data from the microprocessor to an external
                        device, such as a display or printer, in a serial format. For instance, when the microprocessor
                        needs to display a character on a screen, it sends the data through the SOD pin to the display
                        device.</li>

                <h3>Five Hardware Interrupts in 8085</h3>
                <p>Interrupts in the 8085 microprocessor provide a mechanism for handling time-sensitive tasks and
                    events. There are five main hardware interrupts:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>TRAP:</strong> Handles urgent or critical tasks that need immediate attention. For
                        instance, if there's an emergency shutdown command, TRAP ensures it's executed without delay.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>RST 7.5:</strong> Handles critical system events like power failures. For example, if
                        there's a sudden loss of power, RST 7.5 ensures that essential data is saved before the system
                        shuts down.</li>
                    <li><strong>RST 6.5:</strong> Manages communication with external devices. For instance, when a
                        peripheral device needs to send data to the microprocessor, RST 6.5 ensures smooth communication
                        and data transfer.</li>
                    <li><strong>RST 5.5:</strong> Deals with data processing tasks. For example, if there's a complex
                        calculation that needs to be performed, RST 5.5 handles this processing efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>INTR:</strong> Manages general-purpose interrupt requests from external devices. For
                        example, if a device wants to send a message or request to the microprocessor, INTR facilitates
                        this communication.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>INTA (Interrupt Acknowledge):</strong> INTA is not an interrupt but a signal that the
                    microprocessor sends to acknowledge an interrupt request. For example, when an external device sends
                    an interrupt request, INTA allows the device to proceed with sending data or instructions to the
                    microprocessor.</p>

                <h3>Address and Data Pins</h3>
                <p><strong>Address Bus:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The address bus is used to send memory addresses from the microprocessor to the memory unit.
                    </li>
                    <li>It selects one of the many locations in memory where data is stored or retrieved.</li>
                    <li>The size of the address bus is 16 bits, allowing it to address up to 64K (64 kilobytes) of
                        memory locations.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Data Bus:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The data bus is responsible for transferring data between the microprocessor and memory or
                        input/output devices.</li>
                    <li>The data bus in the 8085 microprocessor is 8 bits wide, meaning it can transmit or receive 8
                        bits of data at a time.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>AD<sub>0</sub>-AD<sub>7</sub> (Address/Data Pins):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AD<sub>0</sub>-AD<sub>7</sub> pins are multiplexed, serving both as lower-order address pins and
                        data bus lines.</li>
                    <li>This multiplexing reduces the number of pins required and optimizes the microprocessor's
                        interface with memory and devices.</li>
                    <li>These pins are bidirectional, allowing them to transmit either address or data information based
                        on the current operation.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>A<sub>8</sub>-A<sub>15</sub> (Higher-Order Address Pins):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A<sub>8</sub>-A<sub>15</sub> pins carry the higher-order bits of the memory address,
                        complementing the lower-order address provided by AD<sub>0</sub>-AD<sub>7</sub>.</li>
                    <li>These pins facilitate addressing larger memory spaces and are crucial for accessing specific
                        memory locations.</li>
                    <li>During the HOLD and RESET modes, these 8 pins are switched to a high impedance state to avoid
                        conflicts on the bus.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>ALE (Address Latch Enable - pin 30):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The ALE pin in the 8085 microprocessor plays a crucial role in the address bus operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Function:</strong> ALE helps in latching the address on the external address bus during
                        specific machine cycles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> When the microprocessor needs to access a memory location or an I/O
                        device, it sends the address to the address bus. The ALE pin ensures that this address is
                        latched onto the bus at the correct time, allowing data transfer to occur smoothly.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>S<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> Status Pins:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>S<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> are status pins that provide information about the current
                        operation in progress within the 8085 microprocessor.</li>
                    <li>They indicate the specific state or mode of operation the microprocessor is currently
                        executing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Here are the states indicated by the combinations of S<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>1</sub>:
                        <ul>
                            <li>When S<sub>0</sub> = 0 and S<sub>1</sub> = 0, the microprocessor is in a halt state,
                                indicating that it is not actively processing instructions.</li>
                            <li>When S<sub>0</sub> = 0 and S<sub>1</sub> = 1, the microprocessor is performing a
                                write
                                operation, which involves writing data to a memory location or output device.</li>
                            <li>When S<sub>0</sub> = 1 and S<sub>1</sub> = 0, the microprocessor is executing a read
                                operation, where it reads data from a memory location or input device.</li>
                            <li>When S<sub>0</sub> = 1 and S<sub>1</sub> = 1, the microprocessor is engaged in an
                                opcode
                                fetch operation, retrieving the next instruction's opcode from memory for execution.

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>The combinations of S<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> help in understanding the
                        microprocessor's
                        current activity and mode of operation during program execution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>IO/<u style="text-decoration: overline;">M</u> Pin:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the IO/<u style="text-decoration: overline;">M</u> pin is high (1), the
                            microprocessor treats the address on the address bus as an I/O address, indicating data
                            transfer with external devices like keyboards or displays.</li>
                        <li>When the IO/<u style="text-decoration: overline;">M</u> pin is low (0), the
                            microprocessor treats the address on the address bus as a memory address, accessing data
                            from or storing data into memory.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <p><strong><u style="text-decoration: overline;">RD</u> Pin:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This pin is used to initiate a read operation from memory or I/O devices. When the
                        microprocessor needs to fetch data from memory or an input/output device, it activates the
                        RD signal. For example, consider a program that needs to read a value from a sensor
                        connected to the microprocessor. The RD signal is activated to fetch the sensor data into
                        the microprocessor for further processing.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong><u style="text-decoration: overline;">WR</u> Pin:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The WR pin is activated to initiate a write operation to memory or I/O devices. When the
                        microprocessor needs to store data in memory or send output to an external device, it
                        activates the WR signal. For instance, imagine a program that calculates a result and needs
                        to store it in a specific memory location. The WR signal is activated to write the result
                        into the designated memory address.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>READY Pin:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ready Pin:</strong> This pin signals when the microprocessor is ready to process
                        instructions after completing a previous operation. For example, if the microprocessor is
                        performing a complex calculation, the Ready Pin goes high when it's ready to execute the
                        next
                        instruction.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>HLDA (Hold Acknowledge) Pin:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This pin signals to external devices that the
                        microprocessor is temporarily pausing its operation and can't respond to new requests. For
                        instance, during a DMA (Direct Memory Access) transfer, HLDA indicates that the
                        microprocessor
                        is holding off its operation to allow DMA to access memory without interference.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>HOLD Pin:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>When activated, the HOLD pin indicates to the microprocessor that an
                        external device is requesting control of the system bus. For example, if a peripheral device
                        needs to transfer data or instructions, it asserts the HOLD pin to pause the
                        microprocessor's
                        operation and gain access to the system bus for its task.</li>

                            2000H, it places the address 2000H on the address bus to access the ROM.</li>

                <li>Data Bus:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The data bus is a bidirectional bus that carries data between the microprocessor and
                            external devices. It is used to transfer both input and output data between the
                            microprocessor and memory or I/O (Input/Output) devices.</li>
                        <li>Example: When writing data to a RAM chip, the microprocessor places the data on the data
                            bus, and the data is then written to the specified memory location indicated by the
                            address bus.</li>

                <li>Control Bus:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The control bus is a collection of various control signals that coordinate and control
                            the operations of the microprocessor and external devices. It includes signals such as
                            Read (RD), Write (WR), Memory/IO (M/IO), and various status signals.</li>
                        <li>Example: The RD signal is activated when the microprocessor wants to read data from an
                            external device, and the WR signal is activated when writing data to an external device.

                <h3>Memory Mapping</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Memory mapping refers to the process of assigning specific address ranges to different types and
                        sizes of memory, as well as I/O devices, in a computer system.</li>
                    <li>It allows the microprocessor to access and manage various memory locations and peripherals
                        efficiently.</li>
                    <li>Memory mapping is crucial for organizing memory segments such as ROM, RAM, and I/O ports,
                        ensuring that the microprocessor can interact with them correctly.</li>
                    <li>Specific address ranges are allocated to different memory and I/O segments, enabling the
                        microprocessor to read from and write to these locations during program execution.</li>
                    <li>Memory mapping techniques include direct mapping, bank switching, and memory-mapped I/O, each
                        serving specific purposes in managing memory and device access.</li>

                <p><strong>Memory Mapping Numerical Example 1:</strong> Determine the last address of a 4KB memory chip
                    if its starting
                    address is 8000H.</p>

                <p>To determine the last address of a 4KB (kilobyte) memory chip starting at address 8000H, we follow
                    these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the size of the memory chip:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>4KB = 4 * 1024 bytes = 4096 bytes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Convert the starting address to decimal:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Starting address: 8000H (hexadecimal)</li>
                        <li>Convert to decimal: 32768 (8000H = 32768 in decimal)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Calculate the last address:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Last address = Starting address + Size of memory - 1</li>
                        <li>Last address = 32768 + 4096 - 1</li>
                        <li>Last address = 36863</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>

                <p>Therefore, the last address of the 4KB memory chip starting at address 8000H is 36863 (decimal) or
                    8FFFH (hexadecimal).</p>
