                <p>Basic Question</p>
                <p>Q: A can do a piece of work in 20 days, and B alone can do it in 30 days. In how many days can A and
                    B
                    complete the work together?</p>
                <pre>
        Time       Total work    Efficiency 
A ->  20 Days     60 Units      60/20 = 3 units 
B ->  30 Days                   60/30 = 2 units
            </pre>
                <p>
                    LCM of days = 60 <br>
                    Assume total work = 60 Units<br>
                    Next, we find efficiency. Efficiency is the work completed in a given time (days, minutes, hours)
                    according to the question.<br>
                    Now, we get to know that A takes 20 days to complete 60 units of work.<br>
                    <b>Work done in one day by A = 60/20 = 3 units</b><br>
                    Work done in one day by B = 60/30 = 2 units<br>
                    Now, if both A and B work together, then 3 + 2 = 5 units of work will be completed in a day.<br>
                    Therefore, 60 units of work at the rate of 5 units per day will take 60/5 = 12 days.<br>
                    So, when A and B work together, the work will be done in 12 days.<br>
                    <b>Formula:</b><br>
                    Time = Work / Efficiency <br>
                    In this case, Work = 60 units, and the combined efficiency of both A and B is 5 units/day.<br>
                    Therefore, Time = 60 / 5 = 12 days.

                    do it in 25 days. In how many days can A alone finish the work?</p>
                <pre>
          Time        Total Work     Efficiency 
A + B =  15/2 days      75 units   (75 * 2) / 15  = 10

                <p>
                    While taking the LCM ignore the denominator part. <br>
                    Combined efficiency of A and B = 10 units/day<br>
                    Efficiency of B alone = 3 units/day<br>
                    Therefore, efficiency of A alone = 10 - 3 = 7 units/day<br>
                    <b>Formula:</b><br>

                    Efficiency of C alone = 3 units/day<br>
                    Therefore, efficiency of A alone = 9 - 4 - 3 = 2 units/day<br>
                    <b>Formula:</b><br>

A takes to do 1/2 of the work in 5 days

                    <br>B + C = 5 --(2)
                    <br>upon addition of (1) and (2) equation we will get 2B + A + C = 20 --(3)
                    <br>we know A + C = 14, replace A + C with 14 in equation (3)
                    <br>2B + 14 = 20

                <p>
                    If A and B work together, they will complete 9 units of work in a day<br>
                    In 5 days, both worked together, so:<br>
                    5 * 9 = 45 units of work completed in 5 days<br>
                    Remaining work which A has to do = 100 - 45 = 55 units<br>

                    T = 11 days<br>

                    <br>A = 2.5 units/day

                    The multiple of 13 which is under 42 is 13 * 3 = 39. <br>

                    An important point: This remaining work will be assigned to the person who started the work, in this

                    A can do 7 units in one day. <br>
                    So, for 1 unit, he will take 1/7 day. <br>

                <p>Method 1: Work and time ratio</p>
                <p>
                    We should know that Efficiency ∝ <math>
                        <mfrac>
                            <mn>1</mn>
                            <mn>time</mn>
                        </mfrac>
                    </math> (since work is constant).<br>
                    According to the question, if A's efficiency is 150 and B's efficiency is 100 (as A's efficiency is
                    50% more than B), the ratio of their efficiencies will be 150:100.<br>
                    Simplifying the ratio of efficiencies, we get 3:2.<br>
                    Since efficiency is inversely proportional to time, the ratio of time taken will be the inverse of
                    the efficiency ratio, which is 2:3.<br>
                    If B takes 36 days to complete the work (3 units of time), then:<br>
                    1 unit of time = 36 days / 3 = 12 days<br>
                    So, 2 units of time = 2 * 12 days = 24 days<br>
                    Therefore, A will take 24 days to complete the work.
                </p>
                <p>Method 2: Common Sense Approach</p>
                <pre>
       A       B
E ->  150  :  100
E ->   3   :   2

                <p>
                    Now, B alone can complete the work in 36 days, and his efficiency is 2 units per day. So, in 36
                    days, he will complete:<br>
                    2 units/day * 36 days = 72 units of work (total work).<br>
                    Since A's efficiency is 3 units per day, the total work (72 units) will be completed by A in:<br>
                    72 units / 3 units/day = 24 days.<br>
                    Therefore, A will take 24 days to complete the work.

                    days.<br>
                    Now, according to the ratio of time, the difference between them is 2 units.<br>
                    This means 2 units of time = 24 days.<br>
                    So, 1 unit of time = 12 days.<br>
                    Now, we calculate the total work = A's efficiency (3) * Time taken to complete the work (12 days) =
                    36 units.<br>
                    Combined efficiency = 4 units/day, so 36 / 4 = 9 days.<br>

                    A + B = 18 units/day<br>
                    And we know A's efficiency = 12 units/day<br>
                    12 + B = 18<br>
                    B = 6 units/day<br>
                    Now, total work = 18 * 14 = 252 units<br>
                    B alone will do it in 252 / 6 = 42 days

                <p>Q: 15 men working 8 hours/day make a dam in 10 days. In how many days will 12 men working 10
                    hours/day make it?</p>

                <p>
                    Concept:
                <ul>
                    <li>Work = Man * Days * Time (hours)</li>
                    <li>Now, how do we get this?</li>
                    <li>Suppose 1 man in 1 hour works 1 unit/day of work.</li>
                    <li>In 8 hours, he will work 8 units/day.</li>
                    <li>Now, 15 men working 8 hours/day will do 15 * 8 units/day of work.</li>
                    <li>If these 15 men work for 10 days, they will complete 15 * 8 * 10 units of work, which is the
                        total
                        work.</li>
                    <li>So it becomes M1 * D1 * T1 = M2 * D2 * T2.</li>
                    <li>Since they have to do the same work, we can compare and set them equal to each other.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    M1 * D1 * T1 = M2 * D2 * T2<br>
                    15 * 10 * 8 = 12 * D2 * 10<br>
                    15 * 80 = 12 * 10 * D2<br>
                    1200 = 120 * D2<br>
                    D2 = 10<br>
                    So, it will take 10 days to complete the same work with 12 men working 10 hours a day.

                <p>Q: 24 laborers working 8 hours/day make a road in 15 days. 48 laborers working 6 hours/day in how
                    many days will make the triple long road?</p>
                <p>
                    Concept:
                    <br>3(M1 * D1 * H1) = M2 * D2 * H2
                    <br>3(24 * 15 * 8) = 48 * D2 * 6
                    <br>Calculate the total work:
                    <br>3 * (24 * 15 * 8) = 3 * 2880 = 8640
                    <br>Set up the equation:
                    <br>8640 = 48 * D2 * 6
                    <br>Solve for D2:
                    <br>8640 = 288 * D2
                    <br>D2 = 8640 / 288
                    <br>D2 = 30
                    <br>So, in 30 days, 48 laborers working 6 hours a day will finish the triple long road.

                <p>Q: A contractor contracted to finish a work in 62 days. He employed 32 men to work. But 1/3rd of the
                    work was done in 30 days. How many additional men would be employed so that the remaining work is
                    finished on time?</p>
                <p>
                    32 (men) * 30 (days) = 960 units of work done by them
                    <br>Total work = 960 * 3 (since 1/3 of the work is 960 units)
                    <br>Total work = 2880 units
                    <br>Remaining work = 2880 - 960 = 1920 units
                    <br>Remaining days = 62 - 30 = 32 days
                    <br>We need to find the additional men required to finish the remaining work in the remaining days
                    <br>(32 + x) * 32 (days) = 1920 units
                    <br>(32 + x) = 1920 / 32
                    <br>(32 + x) = 60
                    <br>x = 60 - 32
                    <br>x = 28
                    <br>So, 28 additional men will be required to finish the remaining work on time.

                <p>Q: 1 Man or 2 Boys or 3 Girls can do a piece of work in 88 days. In how many days can 1 man, 1 boy,
                    and 1 girl together do the same work?</p>
                <p>We got to know that the efficiencies of 1 man = 2 boys = 3 girls.</p>
                <pre>

</pre>
                <p>
                    The reciprocal becomes the ratio here.
                    <br>To remove the denominator, we multiply the ratio by the LCM (6).
                    <br>Total work = 6 (units/day) * 88 (days) = 528 units
                    <br>Now, this work has to be done by 1 man, 1 boy, and 1 girl.
                    <br>Combined efficiency of all = 6 (man) + 3 (boy) + 2 (girl) = 11 units/day
                    <br>So, it will take (528 units) / (11 units/day) = 48 days.
