            <h2>Percentage</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Percentage is a concept used to express proportions or rates as fractions of 100.</li>
                <li>For example, if we have a whole pizza and someone asks for half (1/2), we are giving them 50% of the
                    pizza. Similarly, if they ask for one-third (1/3), we will give them approximately 33.33% of the
                    pizza. Percentages allow us to compare different quantities relative to a whole or each other.</li>
                <li>Percentages are denoted using the symbol "%," with 100% representing the entirety or completeness of
                    something. They are widely used in various fields such as mathematics, finance, statistics, and
                    everyday life for expressing ratios, proportions, discounts, interest rates, and more.</li>
                <li>In mathematical terms, to convert a fraction to a percentage, you multiply the fraction by 100.
                    Conversely, to convert a percentage to a fraction, you divide the percentage by 100 and simplify if
                    needed.</li>
                <li>Understanding percentages is fundamental in areas like business, economics, education, and data
                    analysis, as they provide a standardized way to express and compare relative values.</li>

                        </math> * 260 = 26
                        <br>Quick way: For 10%, move the decimal point one place to the left. So, 26.0 becomes 26
                        (answer).

                    <li>Find 10% of 4556:
                        <br>Quick way: Move the decimal point one place to the left for 10%, giving us 455.6.
                        <br>So, 10% of 4556 is 455.6.
                    </li>
                    <li>Find 1% of 4556:
                        <br>Quick way: Move the decimal point two place to the left for 1%, giving us 45.56.
                        <br>So, 1% of 4556 is 45.56.
                    </li>
                    <li>Find 20% of 260:
                        <br>We can express 20% as 2 * 10%.
                        <br>So, 10% of 260 = 26.
                        <br>Now, we multiply this by 2 to get 52.

                    <li>Find 40% of 260:
                        <br>We can express 40% as 4 * 10%.
                        <br>So, 10% of 260 = 26.
                        <br>Now, we multiply this by 4 to get 104.
                    </li>
                    <li>Find 43% of 260:
                        <br>To find 43%, we can break it down into 40% and 3% since we know how to find 40% easily and
                        also how to find 1%.
                        <br>40% of 260 = 104
                        <br>1% of 260 = 2.6
                        <br>3% = 3 * 1% = 3 * 2.6 = 7.8
                        <br>Now, add 40% and 3%: 104 + 7.8 = 111.8
                        <br>So, 43% of 260 is 111.8.
                    </li>
                    <li>Find 58% of 260:
                        <br>To find 58%, we can break it down into 60% and 2% (since 60 - 2 = 58), as we know how to
                        find 60% easily and also how to find 1%.
                        <br>60% of 260 = 156
                        <br>1% of 260 = 2.6
                        <br>2% = 2 * 1% = 2 * 2.6 = 5.2
                        <br>Now, subtract 2% from 60%: 156 - 5.2 = 150.8
                        <br>So, 58% of 260 is 150.8.

                <h3>Some concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>18% of 24 + 7% of 24
                        <ul>
                            <li>we take 24 as common
                                <br>24(18% + 7%)
                                <br>it become of 25% of 24 = 6
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Now 24% of 18 + 7% of 24
                        <br><strong>Concept: a% of b = b% of a</strong>
                        <br>so we can write 24% of 18 + 24% 0f 7
                        <br>24% of (18 + 7)
                        <br>24% of 25
                        <br>we can also write 25% of 24 = 6
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Percentage Increase</h3>
                <p><strong>Increase 800 by 20% or add 20% of 800 to itself.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>800 + 20% of 800 = 800 + 160 = 960</li>
                    <li>When it says "increase," we multiply by 100% plus that percentage, so here we multiply by 120%.
                        <br><math>
                            <mfrac>

                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Percentage Decrease</h3>
                <p><strong>Decrease 800 by 25% or subtract 25% of 800 from itself.</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>800 - 25% of 800 = 800 - 200 = 600</li>
                    <li>When it says "decrease," we multiply by 100% minus that percentage, so here we multiply by 75%.
                        <br><math>
                            <mfrac>

                            </mfrac>
                        </math>. For example, 25% as a

                <p>Percentage is based on what it is compared with; the base goes in the denominator.</p>

                    <li>2 is what % of 5?
                        <br>Here, 5 is the base, so it goes in the denominator:
                        <br><math>

                    <li>5 is what % of 2?
                        <br>Here, 2 is the base, so it goes in the denominator:

                        </math> * 100 = 250%
                    </li>
                    <li>5 is what % more than 2?
                        <br>Here, the base is 2, and since it's "more," the numerator is the difference (5 - 2 = 3):

                        </math> * 100 = 150%
                    </li>
                    <li>2 is what % less than 5?
                        <br>Here, the base is 5, and since it's "less," the numerator is the difference (5 - 2 = 3):

                    <li>CP - Cost Price: The price at which a product is purchased, for example, the cost of acquiring

                    <li>If CP &gt; SP, then it results in a loss because the selling price is less than the cost price,
                        indicating a negative financial outcome.</li>
                    <li>If SP &gt; CP, then it results in a profit because the selling price is higher than the cost

            <h2>Dishonest Shopkeeper</h2>
            <p>In this scenario, a shopkeeper employs fraudulent techniques to maximize profit. Some of these techniques
                include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Selling items above their Cost Price (CP).
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, selling a product that costs $50 at $70.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Selling items at CP but reducing the actual weight.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, selling a kilogram of vegetables at
                            $5 but providing only 800 grams.</li>
                        <li>For example, if 1 gram of a product costs Rs. 1 and the shopkeeper manipulates the weight so
                            that 1000 grams of the same product only weigh 900 grams when sold, the calculation would be
                            as follows:
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Actual cost of 1000 grams = 1000 grams * Rs. 1 per gram = Rs. 1000</li>
                                <li>But the shopkeeper sells only 900 grams at Rs. 1 per gram, which should be Rs. 900
                                    based on the actual weight.</li>
                                <li>Profit = Rs. 1000 - Rs. 900 = Rs. 100</li>
                                <li>Profit percentage = (Profit / Actual cost) * 100 = (100 / 900) * 100 â‰ˆ 11.11%</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>900 grams of the product only weigh 800 grams when sold, the calculation would be as
                            follows:
                            <ul>

                                <li>But the shopkeeper sells the 800-gram product for Rs. 900, resulting in a profit.
                                </li>
                                <li>Profit = Rs. 900 (selling price) - Rs. 800 (actual cost) = Rs. 100</li>
                                <li>Profit percentage = (Profit / Actual cost) * 100 = (100 / 800) * 100 = 12.5%</li>

                                <li>But the shopkeeper sells only 700 grams at Rs. 1 per gram, which should be Rs. 700
                                    based on the actual weight.</li>
                                <li>Profit = Rs. 1000 (selling price) - Rs. 700 (actual cost) = Rs. 300</li>

                        <li>800 grams of the product only weigh 300 grams when sold, the calculation would be as
                            follows:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Actual cost of 800 grams = 800 grams * Rs. 1 per gram = Rs. 800</li>
                                <li>The shopkeeper sells 300 grams but claims it as 800 grams, so the claimed selling price is Rs. 800</li>
                                <li>Actual cost for 300 grams = 300 grams * Rs. 1 per gram = Rs. 300</li>
                                <li>Profit = Rs. 800 (claimed selling price) - Rs. 300 (actual cost) = Rs. 500</li>

                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Selling items above CP while also reducing the weight.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, selling a product that costs $30
                            at $40 but providing only 80% of the advertised quantity.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Using inflated weights during purchases and using lesser weights during sales.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, showing that he bought only 1 kilogram of fruit, but in reality, he reports it
                            as 1.5 kilograms during purchase, then sells 1 kilogram at the market price.</li>
                        <li>The shopkeeper claims to buy 1100 grams of a product but records it as only 1000 grams.
                            Then, the shopkeeper sells this reduced quantity of 900 grams.
                            <br>This means the shopkeeper is making a profit when selling by selling less than the
                            stated quantity (1000 grams instead of 1100 grams).
                            <br>So, in this situation, the shopkeeper gains profit by misrepresenting the quantity
                            during purchase and then selling less than what was stated, resulting in a profit both when
                            buying and selling.
                            <br>This kind of behavior is called a successive scenario, where the shopkeeper benefits at
                            both ends of the transaction.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>These deceptive practices enable the shopkeeper to increase profits unfairly at the expense of customers.
