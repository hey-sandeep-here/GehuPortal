        <h3>Relation Between Time, Speed, and Distance</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Speed = Distance / Time</strong></li>
            <li>If time is constant, there is a direct relationship between speed and distance. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppose A and B are traveling with speeds of 60 km/h and 40 km/h respectively, and the time t is
                        fixed at 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>The distance traveled by A = 2 * 60 = 120 km</li>
                    <li>The distance traveled by B = 2 * 40 = 80 km</li>
                    <li>The ratio of their speeds is 60:40 or 3:2.</li>
                    <li>The ratio of their distances is 120:80 or 3:2, showing that distance is directly proportional to
                        speed when time is constant.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If the distance is constant, speed and time are inversely proportional to each other. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Suppose A and B are traveling a fixed distance of 120 km.</li>
                    <li>A travels at a speed of 60 km/h, so the time taken by A = 120 / 60 = 2 hours.</li>
                    <li>B travels at a speed of 40 km/h, so the time taken by B = 120 / 40 = 3 hours.</li>
                    <li>The ratio of their speeds is 60:40 or 3:2.</li>
                    <li>The ratio of their times is 2:3, showing that time is inversely proportional to speed when
                        distance is constant.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If A starts at 10 PM and moves towards B with a speed of 80 km/h, and B also starts at 10 PM and moves
                towards A with a speed of 20 km/h, they will meet at point X. At point X, they took the same amount of
                time. No matter the speed, they will take the same amount of time to meet, but the one with the greater
                speed will cover more distance. Therefore, A will be closer to B's starting point. This demonstrates
                that speed impacts distance. In summary, if two bodies start at the same time and move towards each
                other, the one with the higher speed will cover more distance, and they will meet at the same time.<ul>
                    <li>Example:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A and B start at 10 PM.</li>
                            <li>A's speed = 80 km/h</li>
                            <li>B's speed = 20 km/h</li>
                            <li>Suppose they meet after t hours.</li>
                            <li>The distance covered by A in t hours = 80t km</li>
                            <li>The distance covered by B in t hours = 20t km</li>
                            <li>If the total distance between them is D, then 80t + 20t = D</li>
                            <li>100t = D</li>
                            <li>So, t = D / 100</li>
                            <li>Both A and B will take the same time t to meet at point X, but A will cover a greater
                                distance (80t km) compared to B (20t km).</li>

            <h2>Practice Questions:</h2>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>A and B started driving towards each other from points X and Y at speeds of 72 km/h and 56 km/h, respectively, in order to meet each other. A had traveled 12 km more than B. Find the distance between X and Y.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>We know that when they meet, the time taken by both A and B will be the same.
                        <br>Time = Distance / Speed.
                        <br>Suppose B traveled 'd' distance, then A will travel (d + 12) distance.
                        <br>Since time taken by both is the same:
                        <br>(d + 12) / 72 = d / 56
                        <br>To solve for 'd', cross-multiply:
                        <br>(d + 12) * 56 = d * 72
                        <br>56d + 672 = 72d
                        <br>72d - 56d = 672
                        <br>16d = 672
                        <br>d = 42 km
                        <br>So, A traveled 42 + 12 = 54 km.
                        <br>And B traveled 42 km.
                        <br>Hence, the distance between X and Y is 54 + 42 = 96 km.
                    </li>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>A and B start driving from P towards Q. The distance between P and Q is 144 km. The speed of A is 18
                    km/h less than that of B. After reaching Q, B immediately returns to P and meets A at a distance of
                    24 km from Q. What is the speed of A?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When they meet, the time taken by both A and B will be the same.
                        <br>The distance traveled by B when they meet = 144 km (P to Q) + 24 km (returning towards P) =
                        168 km.
                        <br>The distance traveled by A when they meet = 144 km (total distance from P to Q) - 24 km
                        (distance from Q) = 120 km.
                        <br>Let B's speed be x km/h. Then, A's speed will be (x - 18) km/h.
                        <br>Since the time taken is the same, we can set up the equation:
                        <br>168 / x = 120 / (x - 18)
                        <br>Cross-multiplying to solve for x:
                        <br>168 * (x - 18) = 120 * x
                        <br>168x - 3024 = 120x
                        <br>168x - 120x = 3024
                        <br>48x = 3024
                        <br>x = 63
                        <br>Therefore, the speed of A is 63 - 18 = 45 km/h.
                    </li>
                    <li>Doing it using another method:
                        <br>We know that if time is constant, then the distance is proportional to speed.
                        <br>For distances, the ratio of A:B = 120:168.
                        <br>Upon simplification, we get 5:7.
                        <br>The difference in the ratio is 2 units.
                        <br>The difference between A's speed and B's speed is 18 km/h.
                        <br>So, 2 units = 18 km/h.
                        <br>1 unit = 9 km/h.
                        <br>So, A's speed in units is 5.
                        <br>In km/h, we get 5 * 9 = 45 km/h.
                        <br>Hence, A's speed is 45 km/h.

                    <li>3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> = 13/4

                        <br>1 unit = 10m.
                        <br>Since time is constant, distance is proportional to speed.
                        <br>This means A travels 13 units and B travels 4 units.
                        <br>The distance from A's starting point to the winning post = 13 * 10m = 130m.

                <ul>
                    <li>Here also, the time is constant.
                        <br>If he reduces his speed by 1/15th, it means his original speed was 15 units, and his reduced
                        speed is 14 units.
                        <br>So, the distance will also be proportional. Initially, he traveled 15 units of distance, and
                        with his new reduced speed, he will travel 14 units of distance.
                        <br>He travels 20 km less, which means 1 unit = 20 km.
                        <br>So, 15 units = 300 km.

                <ul>
                    <li>His actual speed = 9 units and his new speed = 13 units.
                        <br>The distance is 13 km, which is constant, so speed and time will be inversely proportional.
                        <br>So, if the speed ratio is 9:13,
                        <br>The time ratio will be 13:9.
                        <br>The difference in time units = 4.

                        <br>As speed and time are inversely proportional (since the distance is the same), the time

                        <br>(5D) / ((S-5)S) = 1
                        <br>5D = S(S-5) --- (4)
                        <br>From equations (3) and (4):
                        <br>Set 15D = 2S(S+15) equal to 5D = S(S-5) multiplied by 3 to eliminate D:
                        <br>15D = 3S^2 - 15S
                        <br>2S^2 + 30S = 3S^2 - 15S
                        <br>3S^2 - 2S^2 = 45S
                        <br>S^2 = 45S
                        <br>S = 45 km/h (since speed cannot be 0)
                        <br>Now, substitute S = 45 km/h back into equation (4):
                        <br>5D = 45^2 - 5 * 45
                        <br>5D = 2025 - 225
                        <br>5D = 1800
                        <br>D = 1800 / 5
                        <br>D = 360 km
                        <br>Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 360 km.
                    </li>
                    <li>We also have a short formula to find the distance:
                        <br>D = ((constant speed * modified speed) / difference between two speeds) * difference in time
                        <br>When the speed is increased by 15 km/h:
                        <br>D = ((S * (S + 15)) / 15) * 2
                        <br>When the speed is decreased by 5 km/h:
                        <br>D = ((S * (S - 5)) / 5) * 1
                        <br>We can equate them both now:
                        <br>((S * (S + 15)) / 15) * 2 = ((S * (S - 5)) / 5) * 1
                        <br>Cancel out the common terms:
                        <br>(S * (S + 15)) * 2 / 15 = (S * (S - 5)) / 5
                        <br>(S * (S + 15)) * 2 = (S * (S - 5)) * 3
                        <br>S * (S + 15) * 2 = S * (S - 5) * 3
                        <br>(S + 15) * 2 = (S - 5) * 3
                        <br>2S + 30 = 3S - 15
                        <br>Solving the equation:
                        <br>2S + 30 = 3S - 15
                        <br>30 + 15 = 3S - 2S
                        <br>45 = S
                        <br>So, S = 45 km/h.
                        <br>Now, using the speed S to find the distance D:
                        <br>D = ((45 * (45 + 15)) / 15) * 2
                        <br>D = (45 * 60 / 15) * 2
                        <br>D = (2700 / 15) * 2
                        <br>D = 180 * 2
                        <br>D = 360 km
                        <br>Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 360 km.

                        <li>When two bodies are traveling in opposite directions, the relative speed is the sum of their

                        <li>When two bodies are traveling in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference of
                            their respective speeds: s1 - s2.</li>

                            the length of the man, pole, or tree is negligible.</li>
                        <li>If it is a platform, tunnel, or bridge, then the distance is the train's own length plus the
                            length of the platform, tunnel, or bridge.</li>
