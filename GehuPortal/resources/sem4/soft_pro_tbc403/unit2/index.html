        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Project Scheduling Basics</h2>
            <p>Project scheduling involves organizing tasks efficiently in software projects. Here are the key steps a
                software project manager follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify Activities:</strong> List all major tasks that need to be completed.</li>
                <li><strong>Break Down Tasks:</strong> Divide tasks into smaller, manageable steps for easier execution.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Understand Dependencies:</strong> Determine which tasks depend on others and the sequence in
                    which they must be completed.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Estimates:</strong> Estimate the time required for each task, considering factors like
                    complexity and resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Create Activity Network:</strong> Visualize task relationships using an activity network or
                    flowchart to see how tasks are interconnected.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Dates:</strong> Set start and end dates for each task, considering dependencies and
                    resource availability.</li>
                <li><strong>Critical Path Analysis:</strong> Identify the critical path, which is the sequence of tasks
                    that determines the project's overall duration. Tasks on the critical path must be completed on time
                    to avoid project delays.</li>
                <li><strong>Allocate Resources to Tasks:</strong> Once tasks are identified and their dependencies
                    understood, the next step is to allocate resources effectively. This involves assigning the right
                    people, equipment, and materials to each task to ensure smooth execution. Factors to consider
                    include availability of resources, their skills and expertise, and any constraints such as budget or
                    time limitations. Proper resource allocation is crucial for meeting project deadlines and achieving
                    goals efficiently.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The first step in scheduling a software project is to list all the activities needed to finish the
                project. Knowing the project details and development process helps managers identify these key
                activities. Next, these activities are divided into smaller, logical parts called tasks. Tasks are then
                assigned to different developers.
                <br>
                Once tasks are divided, the project manager identifies dependencies among them. Dependencies determine
                the order of task execution. For example, if Task A needs Task B's results, Task A must be scheduled
                after Task B because it depends on Task B.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Project Scheduling Basic Principles</h2>
            <p>Effective project scheduling is guided by several fundamental principles that help organize and manage
                tasks efficiently. These principles ensure that projects are broken down into manageable parts, tasks
                are assigned appropriately, dependencies are identified, and progress is tracked through defined
                milestones. Here are the key principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Modularization:</strong> Divide the project into manageable activities and tasks, both in
                    terms of the product and the process.</li>
                <li><strong>Interdependency:</strong> Determine how tasks relate to each other—some must happen
                    sequentially, while others can happen simultaneously or independently.</li>
                <li><strong>Time Allocation:</strong> Assign start and end dates to each task.</li>
                <li><strong>Effort Validation:</strong> Ensure that the number of people working on tasks at any given
                    time doesn't exceed the allocated resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Defined Responsibilities:</strong> Assign each task to a specific team member.</li>
                <li><strong>Defined Outcomes:</strong> Each task should have a clear goal or outcome, such as producing
                    a work product like a component design.</li>
                <li><strong>Defined Milestones:</strong> Associate each task with project milestones that mark
                    completion of significant work products.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Relationship between People and Effort</h2>
            <p>Managing people and effort is crucial in software development. One common misconception among managers is
                the belief that adding more programmers can compensate for falling behind schedule. However, the reality
                is more nuanced. Software engineering deals with the dynamics between people and effort management
                during the product development phase. Here are some key points to consider:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Project Size:</strong> Small projects can often be handled by a single person.</li>
                <li><strong>Team Size:</strong> Larger projects may require additional team members to complete.</li>
                <li><strong>Adding People:</strong> Adding team members late in a project can disrupt schedules as they
                    need time to learn the system, impacting productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Early Staffing:</strong> Staffing more people early in a project can speed up completion,
                    while reducing resources can extend the timeline.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It's important to balance team size and project complexity to ensure efficient progress and timely
                completion.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Task Network</h2>
            <p>The task network, also known as the activity network, plays a crucial role in meeting project deadlines
                in software development. It is a graphical representation of the flow of tasks within a project,
                highlighting major software engineering activities. The task network diagram helps identify the critical
                path and project duration.</p>
            <p>An activity network outlines the various activities in a project, their estimated durations, and their
                dependencies on each other. There are two common representations for activity networks:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Activity on Node (AoN):</strong> In this format, each activity is represented by a
                    rectangular node. The duration of each activity is displayed within its respective node, and
                    directional edges indicate inter-task dependencies.</li>
                <li><strong>Activity on Edge (AoE):</strong> Here, tasks are associated with the edges of the network.
                    The edges display task durations, and project milestones are represented by nodes in the graph.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Scheduling</h2>
            <p>Project scheduling involves defining start and end dates for individual tasks, along with allocating
                resources within a budget. It focuses specifically on tasks, their deadlines, and project dependencies.
            </p>

            <h3>Time-Line Charts / Gantt Chart</h3>
            <p>When creating a software project schedule, the process starts with defining a set of tasks (known as the
                work breakdown structure). Tasks may also be assigned to specific individuals. Based on this
                information, a time-line chart, commonly known as a Gantt chart, is generated. This chart can cover the
                entire project duration or be segmented into charts for different project functions or individuals
                involved in the project.</p>

            <p>Using time-line charts or Gantt charts aids in visualizing project timelines, task dependencies, resource
                allocation, and individual responsibilities.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h3>PERT Charts</h3>
            <p>A PERT chart, also known as a PERT diagram, is a tool used to schedule and organize tasks within a
                project. PERT stands for Program Evaluation and Review Technique. It provides a visual representation of
                a project's timeline. These charts are similar to Gantt charts but are structured differently.</p>

            <h4>PERT Chart Creation Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Identify Project Tasks:</strong> The first step is to collect necessary project information
                    and tasks, including a business case, a communication plan, and an initial kickoff meeting.</li>
                <li><strong>Define Task Dependencies:</strong> Task dependencies show relationships between various
                    tasks. Creating dependencies helps track work, ensure task completion, and establish clear
                    communication. Dependencies are visualized by connecting and numbering tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>Connect Project Tasks:</strong> Once task dependencies are created, PERT is prepared by
                    connecting project tasks using arrows to represent tasks and nodes to represent events or
                    milestones.</li>
                <li><strong>Estimate Project Time Frame:</strong> The overall project time frame is prepared using the
                    critical path method (CPM) and the PERT formula. Time estimates are calculated based on the
                    following parameters:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Optimistic Time:</strong> The minimum amount of time needed to accomplish a task.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Pessimistic Time:</strong> The maximum amount of time needed to accomplish a task.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Most Likely Time:</strong> The best estimate of how long it will likely take to
                            accomplish a task.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The PERT formula is used to calculate the expected duration of tasks and completion time using:
                    (Optimistic Time + (4 × Most Likely Time) + Pessimistic Time) ÷ 6. This can be measured in minutes,
                    hours, days, or weeks.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Manage Task Progress:</strong> The final step is to manage task progress until project
                    completion by closing dependencies and addressing issues along the way.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Example PERT Formula Calculation:</strong> If the optimistic time for a task is 30 minutes, the
                pessimistic time is 60 minutes, and the most likely time is 45 minutes, the PERT formula would be: (30
                min + (4 × 45 min) + 60 min) ÷ 6 = 45 minutes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h3>Staffing</h3>
            <p>Software project managers select their project team members, aiming to identify skilled software
                developers crucial for project success. Good developers enhance team productivity, while poor ones can
                reduce it significantly. Staffing is the process of managing human capital, the organization's most
                important resource, encompassing possession, retention, promotion, and compensation.</p>

            <h4>Staffing Process</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Manpower Planning:</strong> Involves workload and workforce analysis to determine staffing
                    needs. Workload analysis defines required job types and numbers, while workforce analysis assesses
                    available human resources, identifying shortages or surpluses.</li>
                <li><strong>Recruitment:</strong> Involves searching for and encouraging prospective employees to apply.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Selection:</strong> Choosing and appointing suitable candidates through various steps like
                    screening, tests, interviews, and medical exams.</li>
                <li><strong>Placement and Orientation:</strong> Assigning selected candidates to suitable roles for
                    efficiency and personal satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Training and Development:</strong> Providing training internally or externally to improve
                    skills and productivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Performance Appraisal:</strong> Evaluating employees based on predefined standards and
                    providing feedback.</li>
                <li><strong>Promotion and Career Planning:</strong> Transferring employees to higher roles with
                    increased responsibilities and compensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Compensation:</strong> Providing financial and non-financial rewards like salary, bonuses,
                    insurance, and vacations to employees.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h3>Software Configuration Management Concepts and Definitions</h3>
            <p>The configuration of software refers to the state of all project deliverables at any given time. Software
                configuration management (SCM) is responsible for controlling the configuration of software throughout
                its life cycle. The deliverables of software projects include various objects like source code, design
                documents, SRS documents, test documents, user manuals, etc., which are modified by multiple developers,
                leading to new revisions and versions.</p>

            <h4>Software Revision vs Version</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Version:</strong> Created with significant changes in functionality, technology, or the
                    hardware it runs on.</li>
                <li><strong>Release:</strong> Created for bug fixes or minor enhancements to functionality and
                    usability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Configuration Management Activities</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Configuration Identification:</strong> Involves deciding which parts of the system should be
                    monitored.</li>
                <li><strong>Configuration Control:</strong> Ensures smooth changes to the system.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Configuration Identification</h4>
            <p>Objects are classified into controlled, precontrolled, and uncontrolled categories. Controlled objects
                are under configuration control, precontrolled objects will be controlled later, and uncontrolled
                objects are not subject to control. Controllable objects include requirements specifications, design
                documents, tools, source code, test cases, and problem reports.</p>

            <h4>Configuration Control</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Manages changes to objects.</li>
                <li>Affects daily developer operations.</li>
                <li>Developers get private copies of modules to make changes.</li>
                <li>Only one person can reserve a module at a time.</li>
                <li>A reserved module cannot be reserved by anyone else until it's restored.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Need and Importance of Software Configuration Management (SCM)</h2>

            <h4>Need of SCM</h4>
            <p>Software projects often involve multiple contributors, continuous updates, and various versions,
                branches, and authors. Geographically distributed teams working concurrently also require effective
                management. SCM is necessary to accommodate changes in user requirements, policies, budgets, and
                schedules.</p>

            <h4>Importance of SCM</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Controls and manages access to software configuration items (SCIs) to prevent conflicts like two
                    team members checking out the same component simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Ensures proper implementation of changes by providing tools for change management.</li>
                <li>Describes and stores software components effectively.</li>
                <li>Maintains system consistency by automatically generating derived versions upon component
                    modifications.</li>
                <li>Applies throughout the software process as an umbrella activity.</li>
                <li>Tracks and controls activities from project initiation to software decommissioning.</li>
                <li>Helps control change by identifying work products likely to change and establishing relationships
                    among them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Benefits of Software Configuration Management (SCM)</h4>

            <p>Software Configuration Management (SCM) is crucial for managing and controlling the evolution of software
                products. Below are some of the key benefits of using SCM:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Better Quality Control:</strong> SCM organizes the development process, leading to improved
                    quality control and reduced errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> SCM tracks different versions of software, particularly helpful
                    for large projects and collaboration.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>The Software Configuration Management (SCM) Process</h2>

            <p>Software Configuration Management (SCM) is a structured approach that ensures control and management of
                software products throughout their lifecycle. The SCM process involves several key activities that
                contribute to the efficient development and maintenance of software systems.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identification and Establishment:</strong>
                    <p>This step focuses on identifying and establishing configuration items (CIs) from software
                        products. CIs can include various elements such as design documents, source code files, test
                        scripts, and configuration files. Proper identification is crucial for managing these items
                        effectively.</p>
                    <p>For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Naming conventions like "login_v1.2.php" for version control.</li>
                        <li>Organizing folders, such as "Code_D," to indicate daily backups.</li>
                        <li>Defining baseline configurations that ensure the software operates without errors.</li>

            <h2>Infrastructure Setup for Software Development</h2>

            <p>Setting up the right infrastructure is crucial for efficient, organized, and quality-oriented software
                development projects. The following steps outline key aspects of infrastructure setup:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create a Test Environment:</strong>
                    <p>The test environment is where the project is thoroughly tested. All modules are assembled here to
                        ensure they work properly. This environment is dynamic and subject to frequent changes, so
                        having a dedicated test environment is essential for successful software development.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create a QA and Staging Environment:</strong>
                    <p>This environment is used for staging the application and conducting quality assurance testing. It
                        allows project managers to demonstrate the project/product to stakeholders at different stages
                        of production.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>UI Environment:</strong>
                    <p>Developers set up an isolated environment to test the user interface behavior and design. This
                        ensures that the user interface functions as intended.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Create a Pipeline for Automatic Build, Test, and Deploy:</strong>
                    <p>Setting up a pipeline for automatic build, test, and deployment is crucial. When developers make
                        changes, this pipeline automatically triggers responses such as building the product, running
                        automated tests, and deploying the code. This process saves time and reduces errors.</p>
                </li>
