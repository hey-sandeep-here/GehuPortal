            <h2>Concept of Information System</h2>
            <p>An information system (IS) is a combination of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>People</li>
                <li>Hardware (computers and other devices)</li>
                <li>Software (programs and applications)</li>
                <li>Communication networks (internet and other connections)</li>
                <li>Data resources (information and databases)</li>
                <li>Policies and procedures (rules and guidelines)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These parts work together to store, retrieve, change, and share information within an organization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information systems help to organize and analyze data.</li>
                <li>Many organizations handle a lot of data. Data are basic facts or values.</li>
                <li>The purpose of an information system is to turn raw data into useful information that can help in
                    making decisions within an organization.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Components of Information Systems</h2>
            <p>An information system contains the following components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> These are the physical parts of a computer system, such as processors,
                    monitors, keyboards, and printers.</li>
                <li><strong>Software:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are two main types of software: system software and application software.</li>
                        <li><strong>System software:</strong> This includes the operating system, which manages the
                            computer’s hardware, data, programs, and other resources. It also allows the user to control
                            the computer, usually through a graphical user interface (GUI).</li>
                        <li><strong>Application software:</strong> These are programs designed to help users perform
                            specific tasks, like MS Word and PowerPoint.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Telecommunications:</strong> This involves the technology used to connect different computer
                    systems and devices to share information. Connections can be made using wired methods like coaxial
                    cables and fiber optics, or wireless methods like microwaves and radio waves, which support mobile
                    computing.</li>
                <li><strong>Databases (Data Resource):</strong> A database is a collection of organized data that can be
                    easily accessed and managed. Examples include employee records and product catalogs.</li>
                <li><strong>Human resources and procedures (people):</strong> Skilled individuals are essential for any
                    information system. These include technical staff, operations managers, business analysts, system
                    analysts, designers, database administrators, programmers, computer security specialists, and
                    computer operators.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Transaction Processing System (TPS)</h2>
            <p>Transaction processing systems (TPS) are types of operations support systems. TPS record and process data
                from business transactions. There are two types of transaction processing:
            <ol>
                <li>Batch processing</li>
                <li>Real-time (or online) processing</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Transactions are events that happen during business operations, like sales, purchases, deposits,
                withdrawals, refunds, and payments. Information about the customer, product, salesperson, and store must
                be collected and processed.</p>

            <h3>The Transaction Processing Cycle</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Entry:</strong> The first step is collecting and storing business data. For example,
                    transaction data may be collected by point-of-sale terminals using bar code scanners and credit card
                    readers at a retail store.</li>
                <li><strong>Transaction Processing:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In <strong>batch processing</strong>, data from different transactions are collected over
                            time. These transactions are grouped into batches and processed together.</li>
                        <li>In <strong>real-time (or online) processing</strong>, data are processed immediately after
                            the transaction occurs. Examples include ATM transactions and point-of-sale (POS) systems.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Database Maintenance:</strong> TPS updates an organization’s databases to keep data correct
                    and up-to-date. This reflects the changes from day-to-day business transactions. For example, credit
                    sales will increase customer account balances and decrease inventory levels.</li>
                <li><strong>Document and Report Generation:</strong> TPS produces various documents and reports, such as
                    purchase orders, paychecks, sales receipts, invoices, and customer statements.</li>
                <li><strong>Inquiry Processing:</strong> TPS allows users to make inquiries and receive responses using
                    the Internet, intranets, extranets, and database query languages. For example, you might check the
                    status of a sales order, the balance in an account, or the amount of stock in inventory.</li>
            </ol>

                <h3>Decision Making with DSS:</h3>
                <p>DSS is an application of Herbert Simon's model, consisting of three phases:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Intelligence:</strong> In this phase, specific problems are identified. For example, a
                        business may experience low sales in a month. However, the origin of the problem is not clear,
                        which
                        could be due to sales strategies, product quality, etc. The DSS helps in identifying the root
                        cause
                        of the problem (Problem Definition).</li>
                    <li><strong>Design:</strong> Once the problem is defined, the next step is to design its solutions.
                        There can be multiple solutions to a problem, and the choice of an appropriate solution varies
                        depending on the problem. Managers use inquiry, analysis, models, and accounting systems during
                        this
                        phase to develop potential solutions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choice:</strong> In the choice phase, managers select the best solution among the
                        options
                        generated in the design phase. This process may involve evaluating the feasibility,
                        cost-effectiveness, and potential impact of each solution before making a decision.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Managers may iterate through these three steps multiple times until a satisfactory solution is found.
                    The
                    DSS supports this decision-making process by providing data analysis, modeling tools, and scenario
                    planning capabilities.</p>
