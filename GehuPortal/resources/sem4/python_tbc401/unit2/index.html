            <ul>
                <li>Sampling means selecting a group (a sample) from a population from which we will collect data for
                    our research.</li>
                <li>It is a crucial aspect of research because the results of the study heavily depend on the sampling
                    technique used. Therefore, choosing the right sampling method is essential to obtain accurate
                    results that can estimate the population well.</li>
                <li>For example, suppose there is a male population in a city, and the unemployment rate among this
                    population is 8%. By sampling a representative group of males, researchers can estimate the overall
                    unemployment rate in the city more accurately.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Population</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Population is a collection of elements or individuals from which we draw a statistical sample for a
                    study. It is the entire group about which we want to draw a conclusion. The number of elements or
                    individuals in a population is called the population size.</li>
                <li><strong>Sample</strong>, on the other hand, is a subset of the population. It is the specific group
                    from which you collect data. The number of elements or individuals in a sample is called the sample
                    size. The process of selecting a sample is called <strong>sampling</strong>.
                    <ul>
                        <li>For example, suppose we are studying the average height of all students in a school. The
                            population would
                            be all the students in the school, and the sample would be a smaller group of students
                            selected for
                            measurement. The size of the population is the total number of students in the school, while
                            the sample
                            size is the number of students actually measured.</li>
                        <li>Note: The size of the sample is always less than the size of the population.</li>

            </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Why do we need a sample?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>As it is nearly impossible to collect data from each and every individual of the population,
                        sampling helps us attain information about the entire population.</li>
                    <li>While the results from a sample may not be completely accurate, they provide a close
                        approximation
                        of the population. It is crucial that the selected sample is representative of the population
                        and
                        not biased in any manner.</li>
                    <li>For example, consider a study aiming to understand the preferences of coffee drinkers in a city
                        with
                        a large population. Instead of surveying every coffee drinker, which would be impractical,
                        researchers can select a sample of coffee drinkers representing different demographics, such as
                        age,
                        gender, and location. By analyzing this representative sample, researchers can make informed

                <h3>Sampling techniques</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Simple Random Sampling (SRS):
                        <ul>
                            <li>In Simple Random Sampling, everyone in the population has an equal chance of being
                                picked.
                                It's like picking names out of a hat without looking.</li>
                            <li>Example: If you want to know what students think about a new school rule, you put all
                                their
                                names in a box and randomly pick some names. Each student has the same chance of being
                                chosen for the survey.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Stratified Sampling:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In Stratified Sampling, you divide the population into groups (like by age or gender),
                                then
                                randomly pick from each group. This ensures you get opinions from all types of people.
                            </li>
                            <li>Example: If you're studying favorite colors among kids, you group them by age (e.g.,
                                5-7,
                                8-10, 11-13) and randomly choose kids from each group to get a balanced view.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Cluster Sampling:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In Cluster Sampling, the population is divided into clusters or groups, and then
                                clusters
                                are randomly selected. All individuals within the selected clusters are included in the
                                sample.</li>
                            <li>Cluster sampling can be done in two ways:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Single-stage Cluster Sampling: In this method, all elements within the selected
                                        clusters are included in the sample.</li>
                                    <li>Two-stage Cluster Sampling: Here, a random sample of clusters is selected, and
                                        then
                                        a random sample of individuals is taken from each selected cluster.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Systematic Sampling:
                        <ul>
                            <li>In Systematic Sampling, you pick every nth person from a list after a random start. It's
                                like selecting every 5th person from a line.</li>
                            <li>Example: If you want to survey shoppers in a mall, you start by randomly choosing a
                                shopper
                                and then survey every 10th shopper after that.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Convenience Sampling:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Convenience Sampling is picking whoever is easiest to reach. It's quick but may not
                                represent everyone well.</li>
                            <li>Example: If you ask people in a shopping mall about their favorite TV show, you're using
                                convenience sampling because you're only surveying those who happen to be there at that
                                time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note: The sampling techniques — simple, cluster, stratified, and systematic — are all
                        probability
                        sampling techniques and involve randomization. However, convenience sampling is a
                        non-probability (or non-random) sampling technique because it relies on the researcher’s ability
                        to select the sample. Non-probability sampling techniques can lead to biased samples and
                        results.

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Resampling Techniques</h3>
                <p>Resampling is a technique used in statistics and machine learning to manipulate the composition
                    of a dataset by adjusting the distribution of its instances. The primary goal of resampling is
                    to address specific issues within the dataset, such as imbalances, outliers, or to improve the
                    generalization performance of a model. There are several common methods of resampling:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Oversampling:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Oversampling involves increasing the number of
                                instances in the minority class to balance the class distribution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It is used to address imbalances in the dataset,
                                especially when one class is underrepresented.</li>
                            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Techniques include random oversampling, Synthetic Minority
                                Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN).</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you have a dataset with 90% positive cases and 10%
                                negative cases. By oversampling the negative cases, you can create a more balanced
                                dataset for training a classification model.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Undersampling:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances
                                in the majority class to balance the class distribution.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It is employed to mitigate imbalances where one class is
                                overrepresented, which can lead to biased models.</li>
                            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Common approaches include random undersampling, Cluster
                                Centroids, Tomek Links, and Edited Nearest Neighbors.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> In a dataset with 80% positive cases and 20% negative
                                cases, undersampling the positive cases can help balance the class distribution for
                                better model training.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Bootstrapping:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Bootstrapping entails creating multiple subsets of the
                                dataset by sampling with replacement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It is often used in model training and validation to
                                improve model robustness and assess variability in performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Techniques include random bootstrapping and Bagging
                                (Bootstrap Aggregating) in ensemble methods.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> When training a machine learning model, bootstrapping can
                                help create diverse subsets of the data to train different parts of the model,
                                enhancing overall performance.</li>

                    <li>
                        <strong>Cross-Validation:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into
                                multiple subsets for training and testing to assess model performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> It helps evaluate a model's ability to generalize by
                                testing it on different subsets of the data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Methods:</strong> Common types include k-fold cross-validation, stratified
                                cross-validation, Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV), and Time Series
                                Cross-Validation.</li>
                            <li><strong>Example:</strong> In machine learning, cross-validation is used to estimate
                                a model's performance on unseen data by training and testing it on different subsets
                                of the dataset.</li>

                <h3>Statistical Inference</h3>
                <p>Statistical inference is a process in statistics that involves drawing conclusions or making
                    predictions about a population based on a sample of data taken from that population. It encompasses
                    the use of statistical methods to make inferences about the characteristics of a larger group using
                    the information obtained from a subset of that group.</p>
                <p>There are two main branches of statistical inference:</p>

                            <li><strong>Population and Sample:</strong> Population refers to the entire group under
                                consideration, while a sample is a subset used to make inferences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parameter and Statistic:</strong> A parameter is a numerical summary of a
                                population characteristic, while a statistic is a numerical summary of a sample

            <h2>Sampling Distribution & Standard Error</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If we are given a population and we select a sample from it, it's crucial that each element has an
                    equal chance of being selected, which signifies random sampling. Based on sample statistics, we make
                    decisions or estimates about the population.</li>
                <li>Since studying the entire population is often impractical, we use sample statistics to estimate
                    population parameters such as means and standard deviations. These estimations are fundamental in
                    estimation theory, and we also utilize the concept of sampling distribution.</li>
                <li>Before delving into sampling distribution, it's important to understand two key concepts: simple
                    random sampling with replacement (SRSWR) and simple random sampling without replacement (SRSWOR).

                <h3>SRSWR and SRSWOR</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If we have a population with a finite size (N), then the sample will also have a finite number
                        of elements. Sampling from the population can be done in two ways:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>SRSWR (Simple Random Sampling with Replacement):</strong> In this method, after an
                            element is selected, it is placed back into the population before the next selection.</li>
                        <li><strong>SRSWOR (Simple Random Sampling without Replacement):</strong> Here, once an element
                            is selected, it is not placed back into the population for subsequent selections.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Suppose the population size is denoted as N, the sample size as n, and we want to select K
                        samples:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If using SRSWR, the formula for determining K is K = N<sup>n</sup>. This means there are N
                            raised to the power of n possible combinations, considering that elements can be selected
                            more than once.</li>
                        <li>For SRSWOR, the formula for K is K = <sup>N</sup>C<sub>n</sub>, representing the
                            combinations of selecting n elements from N without replacement.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Example: Let's consider a scenario where N = 4 (population size) and the sample size (K) = 2:

                        <ul>
                            <li>For SRSWR: K = 4<sup>2</sup> = 16. This means we can select 16 samples when using SRSWR
                                because elements can be chosen more than once.</li>
                            <li>For SRSWOR: K = <math>

                    <li>Sampling distribution is essentially a theoretical distribution that represents the possible
                        values of a sample statistic, such as the mean or standard deviation, that would be obtained
                        from different samples of the same size taken from a population.</li>
                    <li>We can analyze various types of sampling distributions, including the sampling distribution of
                        the mean, sampling distribution of the standard deviation, and so on, depending on the specific
                        statistic of interest.</li>
                    <li>Let's consider a scenario where we have a population with a size of N, a sample size of n, and
                        we take k samples from this population. In each sample, there will be its own set of statistics
                        parameters like mean, median, standard deviation, and so on. For instance, the mean for sample 1
                        might be denoted as x1, sample 2 as x2, and so forth, similarly for standard deviation.
                        Therefore, the sampling distribution of the mean will comprise a dataset containing each mean
                        value and its associated probability. <br>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Standard Error</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>When we calculate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean, it is
                        referred to as the standard error of the mean, denoted as S. E(<u
                            style="text-decoration: overline;">x</u>).</li>
                    <li>Similarly, we can determine the standard error of the standard deviation and the standard error
                        of variance, indicating that each statistical measure has its own specific standard error.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Mean of Sampling Distribution of Mean</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The mean of the sampling distribution of the mean, denoted as &mu;<u
                            style="text-decoration: overline;">x</u>, is equal to the population mean (&mu;)
                        irrespective of whether we use simple random sampling with replacement (SRSWR) or without
                        replacement (SRSWOR).</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Standard Deviation of Sampling Distribution of Mean</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean, also known as the standard
                        error of the mean, is calculated as &sigma;<u style="text-decoration: overline;">x</u> = &sigma;
                        / &Sqrt;n, where &sigma; represents the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.
                    </li>
                    <li>It's important to note that as we increase the sample size, the standard error of the mean
                        decreases. This is because larger sample sizes lead to less variability in sample means and
                        therefore a more precise estimate of the population mean.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Use of Standard Error:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Setting Confidence Intervals:</strong> Standard error plays a crucial role in
                        establishing confidence intervals. Confidence intervals provide a range of values within which
                        we are confident that the true population parameter lies. The width of the confidence interval
                        is influenced by the standard error, with narrower intervals indicating greater precision in
                        estimation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing of Hypotheses:</strong> Standard error is integral to hypothesis testing,
                        particularly in calculating test statistics such as t-tests and z-tests. These tests compare
                        sample statistics to population parameters and help determine whether observed differences are
                        statistically significant. The standard error is used in the computation of test statistics,
                        aiding in the assessment of hypothesis validity.</li>

                We calculate probability by the number of occurrences in the sample mean. For example, if the occurrence
                of 9 is 4 times out of a total of 16 occurrences, then the probability is 4/16.
                <br>
                Next, we will find the mean of the sampling distribution of the mean and the standard error of the
                sampling distribution of the mean. Additionally, we know that the mean of the sample distribution of the
                mean is equal to the population mean (μ), so we will first find μ.

                <h3>Central Limit Theorem</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that if the population is normally distributed with a
                        mean (&mu;) and standard deviation (&sigma;), then regardless of the sample size, the sampling
                        distribution of the sample mean (x̅) is also normally distributed. The mean of the sampling
                        distribution of the sample mean is equal to the population mean (&mu;<u
                            style="text-decoration: overline;">x</u> = &mu;), and the standard deviation of the sampling
                        distribution of the sample mean is given by the formula:
                        <math>
                            <mfrac>
                                <mn>&sigma;</mn>
                                <msqrt>
                                    <mn>n</mn>
                                </msqrt>
                            </mfrac>
                        </math>
                        where &sigma; is the population standard deviation and n is the sample size.
                    </li>
                    <li>When we say the population is normal, it means that the data follows a bell-shaped curve with a
                        symmetrical distribution around the mean.</li>
                    <li>When the sample size (n) is greater than or equal to 30, the sample is considered a large
                        sample. Conversely, when n is less than 30, it is considered a small sample.</li>
                    <li>However, what happens when the population distribution is non-normal, such as skewed or
                        multimodal distributions? In such cases, the Central Limit Theorem still holds true. Even if the
                        population is not normally distributed, as long as the sample size is large (n &ge; 30), the
                        sampling distribution of the sample mean (x̅) will approximate a normal distribution. This is a
                        key property of the Central Limit Theorem, making it a powerful tool in statistical inference.

                <li>Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and
                    presentation of numerical data. In simpler terms, it involves gathering quantitative data and using
                    it to draw meaningful conclusions. The main purpose of statistics is to make accurate conclusions
                    about a larger population based on a limited sample.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Types of Statistics</h3>
                <p>Statistics can be classified into two main categories:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Descriptive Statistics:</strong> Descriptive statistics involve summarizing and
                        describing the main features of a dataset. This includes measures of central tendency (such as
                        mean, median, and mode), measures of variability (like range, variance, and standard deviation),
                        and graphical representations (such as histograms and box plots). Descriptive statistics help us
                        understand the characteristics of the data without making inferences about a larger population.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Inferential Statistics:</strong> Inferential statistics go beyond describing the data
                        and involve making inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample of data. It
                        allows researchers to draw conclusions about population parameters (such as means or
                        proportions) using statistical methods. Inferential statistics are used in hypothesis testing,
                        estimating population parameters, and making predictions.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>For example, suppose we have collected data on the heights of students in a school. Descriptive
                    statistics would help us summarize this data, such as calculating the average height of students or
                    determining the range of heights. Inferential statistics, on the other hand, would allow us to make
                    predictions about the average height of all students in the school based on our sample data.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Statistical inference is the process of analyzing data and drawing conclusions from it,
                        considering random variations in the data. It's a branch of statistics called inferential
                        statistics.</li>
                    <li>Hypothesis testing and confidence intervals are practical applications of statistical inference,
                        helping us make decisions based on data.</li>
                    <li>Statistical inference is a method used to make decisions about the characteristics of a
                        population by analyzing a sample from that population. It helps assess relationships between
                        variables and estimate uncertainty or variation between samples. The main purpose is to provide
                        a likely range of values for population parameters. Key components for making statistical
                        inference include:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sample Size: The number of observations in the sample, influencing the precision of
                                estimates.</li>
                            <li>Variability in the Sample: The degree of diversity or spread among data points in the
                                sample, affecting the reliability of conclusions.</li>
                            <li>Size of Observed Differences: The magnitude of differences between groups or variables,
                                which indicates the strength of relationships or effects.</li>
                        </ol>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Types of Statistical Inference</h3>
                <p>Statistical inference encompasses various methods used to draw conclusions from data. Some common
                    types of statistical inference include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>One Sample Hypothesis Testing:</strong> This involves testing a hypothesis about the
                        population mean, proportion, or variance using data from a single sample.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confidence Interval:</strong> Confidence intervals provide a range of values within
                        which we are confident that the true population parameter lies, based on sample data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pearson Correlation:</strong> Pearson correlation measures the strength and direction of
                        the linear relationship between two continuous variables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bivariate Regression:</strong> Bivariate regression analyzes the relationship between
                        two variables, typically a predictor (independent) variable and an outcome (dependent) variable.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Multivariate Regression:</strong> Multivariate regression extends bivariate regression
                        to analyze the relationship between multiple predictor variables and an outcome variable.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chi-Square Statistics and Contingency Table:</strong> Chi-square tests assess the
                        independence or association between categorical variables using contingency tables.</li>
                    <li><strong>ANOVA or T-Test:</strong> Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and T-tests are used to compare
                        means of two or more groups to determine if there are significant differences between them.</li>

                <h3>Statistical Inference Procedure</h3>
                <p>The procedure involved in inferential statistics includes several steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Begin with a Theory:</strong> Start with a theoretical framework or concept that you
                        want to investigate.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a Research Hypothesis:</strong> Formulate a specific statement or prediction
                        about the relationship between variables based on the theory.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operationalize the Variable:</strong> Define how you will measure or manipulate the
                        variables in your study to test the hypothesis.</li>
                    <li><strong>Recognize the Target Population:</strong> Identify the population to which you intend to
                        generalize your study results.</li>
                    <li><strong>Formulate a Null Hypothesis:</strong> Develop a null hypothesis that represents the
                        absence of an effect or relationship in the population.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collect a Sample:</strong> Gather a representative sample from the target population to
                        conduct your study.</li>
                    <li><strong>Conduct Statistical Tests:</strong> Use statistical tests to analyze the sample data and
                        determine if the observed differences or effects are significant enough to reject the null
                        hypothesis and support the research hypothesis.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Hypothesis Mean:</strong> This refers to the mean or average value predicted by
                                the research hypothesis based on theory and previous research.</li>
                            <li><strong>Null Hypothesis Mean:</strong> The null hypothesis predicts that there is no
                                significant difference or effect, so the null hypothesis mean represents what would be
                                expected if there were no effect.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>For example, suppose we want to study the effect of a new teaching method on student performance. We
                    start with the theory that the new method will improve learning outcomes (theory). Our research
                    hypothesis states that students exposed to the new method will have higher test scores than those
                    taught using traditional methods. We operationalize variables by defining test scores as the measure
                    of performance. We recognize all high school students as our target population. The null hypothesis
                    states that there is no difference in test scores between the two teaching methods. We collect a
                    sample of students from different schools and conduct statistical tests (such as t-tests or ANOVA)

                <li><strong>Univariate Data:</strong> Univariate data refers to a type of data that involves a single
                    variable or characteristic. In other words, it focuses on analyzing one variable at a time. Common
                    statistical analyses used for univariate data include measures of central tendency (such as mean,
                    median, mode) and measures of dispersion (such as variance, standard deviation).
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you have a dataset containing the heights of students in a
                            classroom. Analyzing the heights of students individually without considering other factors
                            is
                            an example of univariate data analysis.</li>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Bivariate Data:</strong> Bivariate data involves the analysis of two variables
                    simultaneously to determine if there is a relationship or association between them. This type of
                    analysis explores how changes in one variable relate to changes in another variable. Common
                    techniques used for bivariate data analysis include correlation analysis and scatter plots.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Consider a dataset that includes both the amount of time spent
                            studying (variable A) and the exam scores obtained (variable B) by students. Analyzing
                            whether
                            there is a correlation between study time and exam scores represents bivariate data

                <li><strong>Multivariate Data:</strong> Multivariate data involves the analysis of three or more
                    variables simultaneously. It aims to understand complex relationships among multiple variables and
                    often requires advanced statistical techniques such as multivariate regression analysis, factor
                    analysis, or cluster analysis.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Suppose you have a dataset containing information about students'
                            academic performance (exam scores), study habits (time spent studying), and extracurricular
                            activities (participation in sports or clubs). Analyzing how these variables collectively

                <h3>Multivariate Analysis Techniques: Dependence vs. Interdependence</h3>
                <p>When performing multivariate analysis, various techniques are employed to understand the
                    relationships between variables. These techniques can be broadly categorized into two groups based
                    on the nature of relationships:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Dependence Methods:</strong> Dependence methods focus on identifying and analyzing the
                        extent of dependency or correlation between variables within a dataset. These methods are useful
                        for exploring how changes in one variable affect another and assessing the strength and
                        direction of these relationships. Examples of dependence methods include correlation analysis,
                        regression analysis, and covariance analysis.</li>

                    <li><strong>Interdependence Methods:</strong> Interdependence methods go beyond simple dependency
                        and aim to uncover complex interrelationships among multiple variables. These methods explore
                        how variables interact and influence each other in a more intricate manner. They are valuable
                        for detecting patterns, clusters, and structural relationships within the data. Examples of

                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Cluster analysis is a method used to group similar observations or
                        variables into clusters based on their characteristics or patterns. It helps in identifying
                        natural groupings within the data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Segmenting customers into different market segments based on their
                        purchasing behavior, demographics, and preferences using cluster analysis to tailor marketing
                        strategies for each segment.</li>

            <h2>Linear Regression vs Logistic Regression</h2>
            <p>Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are the two famous Machine Learning Algorithms which
                come under supervised learning technique. Since both the algorithms are of supervised in nature
                hence these algorithms use labeled dataset to make the predictions. But the main difference
                between them is how they are being used. The Linear Regression is used for solving Regression
                problems whereas Logistic Regression is used for solving the Classification problems.</p>

                <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the
                        relationship between a dependent variable (usually continuous) and one or more independent
                        variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number
                        of bedrooms, and location using linear regression.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Logistic Regression</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Logistic regression is a statistical technique used when the
                        dependent variable is binary (e.g., yes/no, 0/1). It models the probability of the binary
                        outcome using one or more independent variables.</li>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> Predicting whether a patient has a disease (yes/no) based on factors
                        like age, gender, and medical history using logistic regression.</li>

            <h2>Prediction Error</h2>
            <p>Prediction error, also known as residual error or simply error, refers to the difference between the
                predicted or estimated value from a model and the actual observed value in a dataset. In the context of
                statistical modeling, prediction error is a crucial concept used to evaluate the
                performance of a model.</p>

            <h3>Types of Prediction Errors</h3>
            <p>There are different types of prediction errors, each measured using various metrics:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> MSE is a common metric that calculates the average of the
                    squared differences between predicted and actual values. For example, if a model predicts the
                    housing prices for different houses, the MSE would be the average of the squared differences between
                    the predicted prices and the actual prices across all houses.</li>
                <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> MAE measures the average absolute differences between
                    predicted and actual values and is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE. For instance, in a
                    weather forecasting model, MAE would represent the average absolute difference between predicted
                    temperatures and actual temperatures for a set of days.</li>
                <li><strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):</strong> RMSE is the square root of the mean squared error
                    and provides a measure of the average magnitude of errors in the same units as the predicted and
                    observed values. In a sales forecasting model, RMSE would quantify the average magnitude of
                    differences between predicted sales figures and actual sales figures.</li>
                <li><strong>Residuals:</strong> Residuals are differences between actual and predicted values for each
                    data point. Positive residuals indicate underprediction, while negative residuals indicate
                    overprediction. For example, in a student performance prediction model, residuals would show the
                    differences between predicted and actual exam scores for individual students.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Importance of Understanding Prediction Errors</h3>
            <p>Understanding and analyzing prediction errors is crucial for model evaluation and improvement. Large
                prediction errors may indicate that the model is not capturing important patterns in the data, requiring
                adjustments to the model or dataset.</p>

            <p>It's important to note that achieving zero error is often not possible, and the goal is to minimize
                errors and create a model that generalizes well to new data. Choosing the appropriate metric for
                measuring prediction error depends on the problem's characteristics and desired properties of the model.
