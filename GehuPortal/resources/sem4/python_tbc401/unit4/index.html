                <ul>

                        the
                        condition is true.</li>

                    <li>It allows for a series of conditional checks, and only the block associated with the first true

            <p>Loops are used in Python to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are two main types of loops: for
                loop and while loop.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>For Loop</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or to execute
                        a
                        block of code a fixed number of times.</li>
                    <li>It iterates through each item in the sequence and executes the block of code for each item.</li>
                    <li>Example:</li>

                </ul>
                <div class="code">

                <ul>
                    <li>'range()' function generates a sequence of numbers.</li>
                    <li>Syntax: range(start, stop, step)</li>
                    <li>start (Optional): Starting number of the sequence (default is 0).</li>
                    <li>stop (required): Ending number of the sequence. The sequence will go up to, but not include,
                        this number.</li>
                    <li>step (optional): Step size of the sequence (default is 1).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is
                        true.</li>
                    <li>It continues iterating until the condition becomes false.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Loop control statements allow you to change the execution flow of loops.</li>
                    <li>They include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Break:</strong> Terminates the loop prematurely.</li>
                            <li><strong>Continue:</strong> Skips the current iteration and continues with the next
                                iteration of the loop.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pass:</strong> Placeholder that does nothing. It is used when a statement is
                                required syntactically but you do not want any code to execute.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <div class="wh">
                    <p><strong>Break Statement:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When the `break` statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately
                            terminated,
                            and program control moves to the next statement after the loop.</li>
                        <li>It is commonly used to exit a loop early based on certain conditions, avoiding
                            unnecessary
                            iterations.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example:</p>

                    <p><strong>Continue Statement:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration of a loop and moves to
                            the
                            next iteration.</li>
                        <li>It is useful for skipping certain values or processing logic based on specific
                            conditions
                            within a loop.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <div class="code">

                <p><strong>Usage Considerations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The `break` statement is typically used to exit a loop early based on a condition, while the
                        `continue` statement is used to skip specific iterations.</li>
                    <li>Both statements are commonly used in loops to control the flow of execution and optimize
                        code
                        logic.</li>

            <h2>Functions in Python</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Functions in Python are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They allow you to
                    organize your code into manageable chunks and promote code reusability.</li>
                <li>Defining a Function: You define a function using the def keyword followed by the function name and
                    parameters (if any). The function body is indented below the function definition.</li>
                <li>Functions can take parameters, which are variables passed to the function when it is called.
                    Parameters are specified within the parentheses following the function name.</li>
                <li>Functions can return a value using the return statement. This value can be of any data type,
                    including integers, strings, lists, or even other functions.</li>
                <li>To execute a function, you simply write its name followed by parentheses containing any required
                    arguments.</li>

                    </ul>

                    <li>Python's pass-by-reference behavior for mutable objects is similar to passing by
                        reference in C++ using pointers or references.</li>
                    <li>However, Python's pass-by-value behavior for immutable objects differs from C++'s
                        pass-by-value, which always creates a copy of the object.</li>

                <h3>Keyword Arguments in Python</h3>

                <p>Keyword arguments in Python allow you to specify the name of the parameter you are assigning a value

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Mixing Positional and Keyword Arguments:</strong> You can mix positional and keyword
                        arguments in the same function call. Positional arguments must come before keyword arguments.
                        <ul>

                                (positional), uses default "Hello" for <strong>greeting</strong>, and
                                <strong>!!</strong> for
                                <strong>punctuation</strong>.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Keyword arguments allow you to skip over some parameters and only
                        specify the ones you want to change.</li>
                    <li><strong>Readability:</strong> Using keyword arguments makes it clear what each argument
                        represents, improving code readability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Order Independence:</strong> When using keyword arguments, the order of the arguments
                        doesn't matter, as long as the parameter names are specified.</li>

                <h3>Returning Multiple Integer Values in Python Functions</h3>
                <p>In Python, you can return multiple integer values from a function by using a tuple.</p>
                <h3>Example</h3>

                <pre>
                    <code>
def calculate_numbers(a, b):
    sum_result = a + b
    product_result = a * b
    return sum_result, product_result

# Calling the function and capturing each returned value separately
sum_value = calculate_numbers(5, 3)
product_value = calculate_numbers(5, 3)
print(f"Sum: {sum_value}, Product: {product_value}")

                </pre>

                <p>In this code, the function `calculate_numbers` calculates the sum and product of two integers `a` and
                    `b`. Each value is returned using a separate return statement. When calling the function, each
                    returned value is captured separately.</p>

            <h2>Advanced Functions</h2>
            <p>Advanced functions in programming are those that offer specialized capabilities or allow for more concise
                and efficient coding techniques. One such function type is the lambda function, also known as an
                anonymous function.</p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Lambda / Anonymous Function</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lambda functions are a concise way to create small, anonymous functions in Python.</li>
                    <li>They are defined using the "lambda" keyword followed by a list of arguments, a colon (:), and an
                        expression. This expression represents the function's logic.</li>
                    <li>Unlike regular functions created with the "def" keyword, lambda functions do not require a name,
                        making them suitable for short, one-time use.</li>
                    <li>The syntax for a lambda function is:
                        <pre>
                            <code>
lambda arguments: expression
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        . For example,
                        <pre>
                            <code>
lambda x: x + 1
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        defines a lambda function that takes an argument <strong>x</strong> and
                        returns <strong>x + 1</strong>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Usage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lambda functions are commonly used in situations where a small, temporary function is needed,
                        such as in filtering, mapping, or reducing data.</li>
                    <li>They are often used in conjunction with built-in functions like <strong>filter()</strong>,
                        <strong>map()</strong>, and <strong>reduce()</strong> to perform operations on iterables like
                        lists,
                        tuples, or dictionaries.
                    </li>
                    <li>For example,
                        <pre>
                            <code>
filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
                            </code>
                        </pre>
                        uses a lambda function
                        to filter even numbers from the list.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lambda functions offer a more concise syntax compared to traditional function definitions,
                        especially for simple operations.</li>
                    <li>They are often used in functional programming paradigms where functions are treated as
                        first-class citizens.</li>
                    <li>Lambda functions promote code readability when used appropriately and judiciously.</li>

                <h3>Lambda function with Filter function</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The filter function takes a list as arguments.</li>
                    <li>The filter function is called with a new list returned, which contains items for which the
                        function evaluates to "true".</li>
                    <li>The filter function returns an iterator after the items are filtered through a function to test
                        if the item is accepted or not.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Example: Program using the filter function to filter out only even numbers from the given list: [1,
                    2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The map function in Python takes a function and a list. The function is called with all items in
                        the list, and a new list is returned which contains items returned by the function for each
                        item.</li>
                    <li>Map applies a function to all the items in the list. The advantage of lambda operations can be

                <h3>Lambda function with Reduce function</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The reduce function applies the same operation to the items of a sequence iteratively until it
                        reduces the sequence to a single value.</li>
                    <li>It uses the result of the first operation as the first argument for the next operation,
                        progressively combining elements.</li>
                    <li>Reducing a sequence with a lambda function is a common pattern for performing cumulative
                        calculations or aggregations.</li>
                    <li>This function is part of the Python standard library and is defined in the "functools" module,
                        so we need to import it before using it.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Program to find the sum of numbers in the list using reduce:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
from functools import reduce

mylist = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] 
# Using reduce with a lambda function to add numbers in the list
sum = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, mylist) 
print(sum)  # Output: 28 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>In this example, the reduce function combines the elements of the list by adding them together using
                    the lambda function (x + y). It starts with the first two elements, adds them, then adds the result
                    with the next element, and so on until all elements are combined into a single sum.</p>

            <h2>Module</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A module is a Python file that contains classes and functions, allowing us to use these classes
                    and
                    functions in other files.</li>
                <li>Modules are helpful in debugging because they allow us to organize our code into separate files,
                    making it easier to locate and fix issues.</li>
                <li>We use the "import" keyword to import a module. For example, <strong>import mymodule *</strong>
                    imports all functions from mymodule.py. The <strong>*</strong> indicates importing all functions.
                </li>
                <li>If we want to use a specific function from a module, we can import it like this: <strong>import
                        add
                        from mymodule</strong>.</li>
                <li>In Python, a module is a Python file with a ".py" suffix. Using modules makes it easier to
                    maintain
                    the program, especially for frequently used functions that can be kept in separate files or
                    modules
                    instead of being defined repeatedly.</li>
                <li>There are two main types of modules: user-defined and built-in modules:
                    <ol>
                        <li>User-defined modules are created by the user. Programmers can create their own modules
                            containing functions, classes, variables, etc., and these can be imported into other
                            files
                            using user-defined module imports.</li>
                        <li>Built-in modules are already available in Python, such as math, random, statistics.
                            These
                            modules contain functions like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc., that can be
                            directly used in Python programs without the need for additional installations.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <code>
# newfile.py
import mymodule

mymodule.calculator(num1, num2, operation)

# Using the variable_of_mymodule
print("Value of variable_of_mymodule in newfile.py:", mymodule.variable_of_mymodule)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>If we want to use only one function, we can import it directly:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
from mymodule import calculator
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This imports only the "calculator" function from the "mymodule" module.</p>

                <p>If we want to give an alias name to the imported function:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
from mymodule import calculator as calc
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>This imports the "calculator" function from the "mymodule" module and gives it an alias "calc".
                    We
                    can then use "calc" instead of "calculator" in our code.</p>

            <h2>File Handling</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Why Do We Need File Handling?</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reason 1:</strong> File handling is essential for managing data persistence. It
                            allows us to store data in files for future use and retrieval, ensuring data integrity
                            and
                            longevity.</li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reason 2:</strong> When dealing with large amounts of data, using the console
                            for
                            input/output operations becomes impractical. Storing data in files provides a structured
                            and
                            efficient way to handle and process extensive datasets without overwhelming the console
                            interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Reason 3:</strong> File handling facilitates data sharing and transfer across
                            different platforms and applications. By storing data in files, we can easily exchange
                            information between systems and software components, enabling seamless data integration
                            and
                            interoperability.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>A file is a sequence of bytes where data is stored permanently. It can be seen as a container or
                    a
                    named memory location on disk.</li>
                <li>File handling involves managing these files, which includes operations such as opening a file,
                    reading data from it, writing data to it, and closing it.</li>
                <li>There are two main types of files:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Text files: These store data in a human-readable form, containing sequences of text,
                            characters, and numbers. Examples include files with extensions .txt, .csv, and .py.
                        </li>
                        <li>Binary files: These files cannot be read directly by humans and include data like audio,
                            video, images, and executable files.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Main operations on files include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open: This is the initial step where we access the file for reading or writing.</li>
                        <li>Read: Involves extracting data from the file.</li>
                        <li>Write: Involves adding or modifying data within the file.</li>
                        <li>Close: This finalizes the file operation and frees up resources.</li>
                    </ol>
                    It's important to open a file before performing any operations on it, and after reading or
                    writing,
                    the file should be closed to complete the process.

                <h3>How to Open a File?</h3>
                <p>To open a file in Python, use the following syntax:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="language-python">
file_obj = open("filename", "mode")
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>open()</strong> function returns a file object or file pointer, which we store in a
                        variable.</li>
                    <li>We can then perform read, write, or close operations using this file object variable.</li>
                    <li>Modes specify the type of operations that can be performed on the file. Choose the mode
                        based on
                        the operation you intend to perform:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>r</strong>: Opens the file in read mode.</li>
                        <li><strong>w</strong>: Opens the file in write mode. This truncates the file if it exists
                            or
                            creates a new file.</li>
                        <li><strong>a</strong>: Opens the file in append mode. It adds new data at the end of the
                            file
                            without truncating it.</li>
                        <li><strong>r+</strong>: Opens the file for both reading and writing.</li>
                        <li><strong>w+</strong>: Opens the file for both reading and writing. It truncates the file
                            if
                            it

                <h3>seek() function</h3>
                <p>The <strong>seek()</strong> function in Python is used to change the current file position within an
                    open
                    file. It is particularly useful when working with files that support random access, such as binary
                    files.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Syntax:</strong> <strong>file.seek(offset, whence)</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Parameters:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>offset</code>: The number of bytes to move the file pointer. A positive offset
                                moves the pointer forward, while a negative offset moves it backward.</li>
                            <li><code>whence</code>: Specifies the reference position for the offset. It can take one of
                                three values:
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>0</strong> (default): Offset from the beginning of the file</li>
                                    <li><strong>1</strong>: Offset from the current file position</li>
                                    <li><strong>2</strong>: Offset from the end of the file</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>The <strong>seek()</strong> function is commonly used in conjunction with reading or writing
                    operations
                    to navigate to a specific position within a file before performing file operations.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
# Open a file in read mode
file = open("example.txt", "r")

# Move the file pointer to the 5th byte from the beginning
file.seek(5)

# Read and print the content from the current file position
print(file.read())

# Close the file
file.close()
                    </code>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The "x" mode is used to create a new file. If the file already exists, the operation
                            will
                            fail, preventing accidental overwriting of existing files.</li>
                        <li>This mode is typically used in conjunction with other modes, ensuring that there is

                        object
                        will be positioned at the beginning of the file.</li>
                    <li>On the other hand, in append mode, new data will be added at the end of the previous data,
                        as
                        the file object is positioned at the end of the file.</li>
                    <li>After opening the file, we can use the following methods to write data into the file:

                                to
                                the text file. It returns the number of characters being written on a single

                                of the write function.</li>
                            <li><strong>writelines():</strong> This method is used to write multiple lines of text
                                to
                                the file by passing a list of strings as an argument.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The write method takes a string as an argument and writes it to the text file. It returns
                        the
                        number of characters being written on a single execution of the write function.</li>
                    <li>We can also add a newline character "\n" at the end of every sentence to mark the end of a
                        line.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <div class="dotc"></div>
                    <pre>
        <code>
f1 = open("f1.txt", "w")
f1.write("Hi, this is the line that I'm writing\n")
        </code>
    </pre>
                </div>
                <ul>
                    <li>We need to convert numbers to strings before writing them to a file because the write method
                        only accepts strings. Attempting to write a number directly will result in a TypeError.</li>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <div class="code">
                        <div class="dotc"></div>
                        <pre>
            <code>
num = 123
f1.write(str(num))
            </code>
        </pre>
                    </div>
                    <li>The write function actually writes data to a buffer. When the close function is executed,
                        the
                        contents from this buffer are moved to the file located on permanent storage.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>writelines() Method</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The writelines() method is used to write multiple strings to a file. We need to pass an
                        iterable
                        object containing strings to the writelines() function.</li>
                    <li>Unlike the write() function, the writelines() function does not return the number of
                        characters
                        written in the file.</li>
                    <li>It is useful when we have a list of strings that we want to write to a file without manually
                        looping through each string and using the write() function for each one.</li>
                    <li>Each string in the iterable object passed to writelines() is written to the file as a
                        separate
                        line.</li>
                    <li>This method is commonly used when writing data from a list or other iterable data structure
                        to a
                        text file, such as writing multiple lines of text or data records.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                <div class="code">
                    <div class="dotc"></div>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
# Open a file in write mode
f2 = open("f2.txt", "w")

# List of strings to write to the file
str_list = ["Hi", "Hello"]

# Write the list of strings to the file using writelines()
f2.writelines(str_list)

# Close the file after writing
f2.close()
                        </code>
                    </pre>

                <h3>Reading from a Text File</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To read the contents of a file, we need to ensure that the file is opened in one of the
                        modes:
                        "r" (read), "r+" (read and write), "w+" (write and read), or "a+" (append and read).</li>
                    <li>There are three methods to read content from a file:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>read():</strong> Reads a specified number of bytes of data from a file.</li>
                        <li><strong>readline():</strong> Reads one complete line from a file, terminating at the new
                            line character ("\n").</li>
                        <li><strong>readlines():</strong> Reads all lines from a file and returns them as a list of
                            strings, each line ending with a new line character.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>read() Method:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This method is used to read a specified number of bytes of data from a file.</li>
                    <li>If no argument or a negative number is specified in the read() function, the entire file content
                        is read.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <div class="dotc"></div>
                    <pre>
                        <code>
f1 = open("abc.txt", "r") #make sure this file exists and there is data inside it.
# Reading the entire file
content = f1.read()
print("Content of the file:")
print(content)

# Resetting the file pointer to the beginning
f1.seek(0)

# Reading the first 10 characters
content = f1.read(10)
print("\nFirst 10 characters of the file:")
print(content)
                </code>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>Explanation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>f1.read()</strong>: Reads the entire content of the file <strong>example.txt</strong>
                        and prints it.</li>
                    <li><strong>f1.seek(0)</strong>: Resets the file pointer to the beginning of the file.</li>
                    <li><strong>f1.read(10)</strong>: Reads the first 10 characters from the file
                        <strong>example.txt</strong> and prints them.</li>
                    <li>The file pointer moves forward by the number of characters read, so subsequent reads continue
                        from the current position of the file pointer.</li>
                    <li>If you attempt to read more characters than are left in the file, <strong>read</strong> will
                        return fewer characters than requested, or an empty string if the file pointer is already at the
                        end of the file.</li>
                </ul>


                <p><strong>readline() Method:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This method reads one complete line from a file, terminating at the new line character
                        ("\n").
                    </li>
                    <li>If no arguments or a negative number is specified, it reads a complete line and returns the
                        string.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example:</p>

    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>Explanation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>open()</strong> function is used to open the file "myfile.txt" in read mode ("r").
                    </li>
                    <li>The <strong>readline()</strong> method is then applied to read one complete line from the file
                        and
                        store it in the variable <strong>line</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>print()</strong> function is used to display the content of <strong>line</strong>, which
                        represents the first line of the file.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>readlines() Method:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This method reads all the lines from a file and returns them as a list of strings, each line
                        ending with a new line character.</li>
                    <li>When we read a file using the readlines() function, each line in the file becomes an element
                        of
                        the list, where each list element ends with a new character.</li>

                <h3>Using the "with" Clause in File Handling</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "with" clause is used in Python for file handling to ensure proper handling of
                        resources.</li>
                    <li>It automatically closes the file after the block of code inside the "with" statement is
                        executed, even if an exception occurs.</li>
                    <li>This helps in avoiding common issues like forgetting to close the file, leading to resource
                        leaks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example code:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
    # Perform operations on the file
# File automatically closed outside the "with" block
