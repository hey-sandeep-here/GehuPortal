        <h1>Game Theory</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game:</strong> Game is defined as an activity involving two or more persons following a set of
                rules.
                At the end of the game, participants may gain benefits or incur losses.
                The rules and procedures define the game, which represents a competitive situation or conflict between
                two or more parties.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Game Theory:</strong> Game theory studies interactive decision-making, where the outcome for
                each participant
                (or player) depends on the actions of all others. When deciding on a course of action or strategy,
                players must consider the choices of others.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Uses of Game Theory:</strong> Game theory helps organizations make strategic choices internally
                or externally, especially against competitors.
                <br>It models various situations through hypothetical games, predicting player behavior in competitive
                environments.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Types of Games</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Two-Person and N-Person Games:</strong>
                    In two-person games, there are only two players, though each may have many possible choices.
                    If more than two people are involved, it is called an n-person game.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Zero-Sum Game:</strong>
                    A zero-sum game is one where the total gains and losses of all players equal zero, regardless of the
                    outcome.
                    The points gained by winners are offset by the points lost by losers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Two-Person Zero-Sum Game:</strong>
                    This type involves two players where the gain of one equals the loss of the other.
                    It is often represented by a rectangular pay-off matrix.
                </li>
            </ol>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <p>The term <strong>Strategy</strong> refers to a complete plan of action, specifying what a player will do
                in any
                future contingency during the game. Strategies can be classified as:
                <br>(i) Pure strategy (ii) Mixed strategy
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Pure Strategy:</strong>
                    A strategy is called pure if one knows in advance of the play that it is certain to be adopted,
                    irrespective of the strategy the other players might choose.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Mixed Strategy:</strong>
                    The optimal strategy mixture for each player is determined by assigning probabilities to each
                    strategy.
                    This is called a mixed strategy because it is a probabilistic combination of available choices.
                    Mixed strategies are denoted by a set:
                    <br>S = {x1, x2, ..., xn}, where x is the probability of choosing a course of action.
                    <br>So, x1 + x2 + ... + xn = 1.
                    <br>Note: A pure strategy is a special case of a mixed strategy.
                </li>

        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Pay-Off</h2>
            <p>Pay-off is the outcome of playing the game. A pay-off matrix is a table showing the amount received by
                the player after all possible plays of the game. The payment is made by the player listed at the top of
                the table.
                <br>If Player A has <em>m</em> courses of action and Player B has <em>n</em> courses, the pay-off matrix
                is constructed as follows:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Row designations represent Player A's courses of action.</li>
                <li>Column designations represent Player B's courses of action.</li>
                <li>In a two-person zero-sum game, the entries in Player B's pay-off matrix will be the negatives of the
                    corresponding entries in Player A's pay-off matrix. For example:
                    <pre>
                        <code>
Player A's Pay-Off Matrix:           
           -  1    2    3  ...  n -                  
         1 | a11  a12  a13 ... a1n |
         2 | a21  a22  a23 ... a2n |
         3 | a31  a32  a33 ... a3n |
Player A . |  .    .    .       .  |
         . |  .    .    .       .  |
         m | am1  am2  am3 ... amn |
           -                       -

Player B's Pay-Off Matrix (Negative of A's):           
           -  1     2     3   ...  n -                  
         1 | -a11  -a12  -a13 ... -a1n |
         2 | -a21  -a22  -a23 ... -a2n |
         3 | -a31  -a32  -a33 ... -a3n |
Player B . |   .     .     .       .  |
         . |   .     .     .       .  |
         m | -am1  -am2  -am3 ... -amn |
           -                          -
                    </code>
                </pre>
