        <h1>Introduction to Operations Research (OR) and Optimization Techniques</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Operations Research (OR) is a scientific approach to decision-making that uses mathematical models and
                analytical methods to solve complex problems. OR seeks to determine the best possible course of action
                by optimizing resources, time, and cost, making it invaluable in various industries such as business,
                logistics, healthcare, and manufacturing.</li>
            <li>Optimization techniques, a key part of OR, involve finding the most efficient solution to a problem,
                often by maximizing or minimizing a specific objective. For example, a business may want to minimize
                production costs while maintaining quality, or a logistics company may aim to reduce delivery times.
                These techniques are essential for ensuring that resources are used efficiently, objectives are met, and
                constraints are respected.</li>
            <li>In this context, OR plays a vital role in finding optimal solutions to problems, whether in minimizing
                costs, maximizing profits, or improving efficiency. This unit provides an overview of the meaning,
                significance, and scope of OR, its management applications, key features, quantitative techniques, and
                the role of computers in solving OR problems.</li>

            <h2>Meaning of Operations Research (OR)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Operations Research (OR) refers to the application of advanced analytical techniques to help make
                    better decisions. It involves the use of mathematical models, statistics, and algorithms to analyze
                    complex problems and provide optimal or near-optimal solutions. OR is often described as the science
                    of decision-making, as it aids organizations in planning, managing, and optimizing their operations.
                </li>
                <li>Basically, Operations Research (OR) is a way to solve real-life problems by using math and logic to
                    make better decisions. For example, imagine a delivery company wants to find the shortest route to
                    deliver packages to multiple locations. OR helps the company figure out the best route, saving time
                    and fuel. It's like finding the smartest solution to a problem by looking at all the possible
                    options and choosing the one that works best.</li>
                <li>The primary objective of OR is to provide a rational basis for decision-making by identifying the
                    most effective ways to use limited resources. By modeling real-world systems and analyzing various
                    decision-making scenarios, OR helps in understanding the possible outcomes of different strategies.
                    This leads to more informed and data-driven decisions, which is crucial in both operational and
                    strategic contexts.</li>

            <h2>Features of Operations Research</h2>
            <p>Operations Research (OR) has some key features that make it a reliable and scientific approach to solving
                complex problems. The simplest and most important features of OR are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>System Orientation:</strong>
                    OR takes a holistic approach, looking at the entire system when solving problems. For example, in a
                    supply chain, it ensures that changes in one area don’t negatively impact other areas.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Use of Mathematical Models:</strong>
                    OR uses <strong>mathematical models</strong> to represent real-life problems. These models help
                    decision-makers analyze different scenarios and choose the best solutions.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Optimal Solution:</strong>
                    The goal of OR is to find the <strong>best solution</strong> to a problem by evaluating different
                    options and selecting the one that meets the desired objectives, like minimizing costs or maximizing
                    efficiency.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Quantitative and Data-Driven:</strong>
                    OR uses <strong>data and numbers</strong> to make decisions. This ensures that solutions are based
                    on solid evidence, not guesses or intuition.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Computer-Based Analysis:</strong>
                    Computers are important in OR because they allow for fast calculations and help solve large and
                    complex problems efficiently.

            <h2>Quantitative Techniques of Operations Research (OR)</h2>
            <p>Operations Research (OR) relies heavily on quantitative techniques to analyze and solve complex problems.
                These techniques use mathematical models, statistical methods, and algorithms to provide precise,
                data-driven solutions. Some of the most widely used quantitative techniques in OR include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Linear Programming (LP)</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Linear programming is one of the most popular and widely used techniques in OR. It is used
                            to find the optimal solution to problems involving multiple constraints and objectives. LP
                            helps in determining the best way to allocate limited resources such as labor, materials, or
                            money to achieve a specific objective, such as maximizing profit or minimizing costs. A
                            classic example is determining how much of each product a factory should produce to maximize
                            profits while meeting production limits.</li>
                        <li><strong>Key Tools</strong>: Simplex method, graphical method, duality, and sensitivity
                            analysis.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Integer Programming</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Integer programming is similar to linear programming but deals with decision variables that
                            must be whole numbers (integers). This technique is useful for problems where solutions like
                            "half a machine" or "partial orders" do not make sense. For example, a company may need to
                            determine the number of trucks required for deliveries, and that number must be an integer.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Key Tools</strong>: Branch-and-bound method, cutting plane method.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dynamic programming is a technique used for solving problems that can be broken down into
                            smaller, interdependent stages. It is particularly useful for multi-stage decision-making
                            processes, where decisions made at one stage impact future stages. For example, dynamic
                            programming can be applied to optimize inventory control or project scheduling over time.
