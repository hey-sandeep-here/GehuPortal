            <ul>
                <li>Database is an electronic place/system where data is stored in a way that it can be easily accessed,

            <ul>
                <li>A database-management system (DBMS) is a collection of interrelated data and a set of programs to
                    access those data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information
                    relevant to an enterprise. The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve
                    database information that is both convenient and efficient.</li>
                <li>A DBMS is the database itself, along with all the software and functionality. It is used to perform
                    different operations, like addition, access, updating, and deletion of the data.</li>
                <li>DBMS is used to organize the data in the form of a table, schema, view and report etc.</li>
                <li>The primary goal of a DBMS is to provide a way to store and retrieve database information that is

                        for different purpose.</li>
                    <li>Database management system is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain
                        the database.</li>

            <h2>Characteristics and Applications of DBMS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.</li>
                <li>It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.</li>
                <li>DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.</li>
                <li>It contain ACID (Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability) properties which maintain data in a
                    healthy state in case of failure.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Atomicity: This property ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit
                            of work. Either all of its changes are applied to the database, or none of them are. In
                            other words, if a transaction contains multiple steps, and any step fails, the entire
                            transaction is rolled back, and the database remains unchanged. This prevents the database
                            from being left in an inconsistent state due to partial transactions.</li>
                        <li>Consistency: Consistency ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state
                            to another. In other words, the database should follow certain rules or constraints before
                            and after the transaction. If a transaction violates any of these rules, it is not allowed
                            to be executed. This property maintains the integrity of the data and prevents data
                            corruption.</li>
                        <li>Isolation: Isolation ensures that multiple transactions can be executed concurrently without
                            interfering with each other. Each transaction is executed as if it were the only transaction
                            in the system, even if there are other transactions running at the same time. This prevents
                            issues like data being read or modified by one transaction while another transaction is
                            still in progress, which could lead to incorrect results or data corruption.</li>
                        <li> Durability: Durability guarantees that once a transaction is successfully completed and its
                            changes are committed to the database, they will persist even in the face of system failures
                            (e.g., power outage, system crash). These changes will be permanent and will not be lost.
                            This property ensures that once data is written to the database, it can be relied upon to be
                            available and consistent.

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It can reduce the complex relationship between data.</li>
                <li>It is used to support maniulation and processing of data.</li>
                <li>It is used to provide security of data.</li>
                <li>It can view the database from different viewpoints according to the requirements of the user.</li>

            <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of DBMS</h2>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Advantages</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data Independence</b>: Data independence is the concept that separates the way data is stored
                        from the way it is accessed and used. It ensures that changes made to the structure of the
                        database (schema) do not affect the applications using the data. There are two types of data
                        independence: logical and physical.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Logical data independence allows modifications to the logical structure of the database
                                without impacting the applications. For instance, if a new attribute needs to be added
                                to a table or a relationship between tables is altered, applications accessing the data
                                won't need to be rewritten. This flexibility is vital for adapting to changing business
                                requirements without disrupting the existing software.</li>
                            <li>Physical data independence allows changes in the physical storage details of the
                                database without affecting how data is accessed. For instance, the DBMS can decide to
                                store data on different storage devices, reorganize data files for efficiency, or even
                                change the file format used for storage. These changes can be made transparently to
                                applications, ensuring that their operations remain unaffected.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Efficient Data Access:</b> Efficient data access is a cornerstone of a well-designed DBMS,
                        ensuring that data retrieval and manipulation are performed optimally.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Indexing:
                                Indexes are data structures that speed up data retrieval by providing a quick way to
                                locate specific rows in a table based on certain columns. For example, a database can
                                use a B-tree index to efficiently find records matching a certain value without scanning
                                the entire table. It uses indexing, query optimization, and caching techniques to speed
                                up data access. This is especially important when dealing with large datasets, as it
                                reduces the time it takes to retrieve information.</li>
                            <li>Query Optimization:
                                Query optimization is the process of determining the most efficient way to execute a
                                query. The DBMS's query optimizer analyzes different execution plans and selects the one
                                that minimizes the time and resources needed to fetch the required data.</li>
                            <li>Caching:
                                Caching involves storing frequently accessed data in memory. This reduces the need to
                                fetch data from slower storage devices, such as hard drives, every time it's requested.
                                Caching mechanisms enhance performance by providing faster data access for common
                                queries.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Data Integrity:</b> Data integrity refers to the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of
                        the data stored in the database. A DBMS enforces data integrity constraints, such as uniqueness,
                        referential integrity, and data validation rules. This ensures that the data stored in the
                        database remains reliable and accurate over time.</li>
                    <li><b>Concurrent Access to Data:</b> In a multi-user environment, multiple users or applications
                        might need to access the same data simultaneously. A DBMS manages concurrent access by providing
                        mechanisms like locking and transaction management. This ensures that data remains consistent
                        even when accessed by multiple users concurrently.</li>
                    <li><b>Ensures Data Recovery:</b> A DBMS includes features for data backup and recovery. Regular
                        backups and transaction logs enable recovery in case of hardware failures, system crashes, or
                        human errors. This helps prevent data loss and ensures business continuity.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Security:</b> Data security is crucial to protect sensitive and confidential
                        information. A DBMS provides security mechanisms to control who can access the data and what
                        operations they can perform on it. This includes user authentication, authorization, and
                        encryption of data stored in the database.</li>
                    <li><b>Control database redundancy</b> &rarr; It can control data redundancy because it stores all
                        the data in one single database file and that recorded data is placed in the database.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Database redundancy refers to the situation where the same data is stored multiple times
                                in a database. Redundancy can lead to various issues, such as increased storage
                                requirements, data inconsistency (due to multiple copies of the same data being updated
                                differently), and difficulties in maintaining data accuracy.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Data sharing</b> &rarr; In DBMS the authorized users of an organization can share the data
                        among multiple users.</li>
                    <li><b>Easily maintenance</b> &rarr; It can be easily maintained due to the centralized nature of
                        the database system.</li>
                    <li><b>Reduce time</b> &rarr; It reduces development time and maintenance need.</li>
                    <li><b>Backup</b> &rarr; It provides backup and recovery subsystems which create automatic backup of
                        data from hardware and software failure and restores the data if required.</li>
                    <li><b>Multiple user interface</b> &rarr; It provides different types of user interface like
                        graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Disadvantages of DBMS</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Cost of hardware and software</b> &rarr; It requires a high speed of data processor and large
                        memory size to run DBMS software.</li>
                    <li><b>Size</b> &rarr; It occupies a large space of disks and large memory to run them efficiently.

                    <li><b>Higher impact of failure</b> &rarr; Failure highly impacts the database because in most of
                        the organization all the data stored in a single database and if the database is damaged due to
                        electric failure or database corruption then the data may be lost forever.</li>

            <h2>Database system vs File system</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Database system</b> : A Database System is a structured and organized software application that
                    manages
                    and stores collections of data. It includes a Database Management System (DBMS) along with the
                    actual databases it manages. The DBMS handles tasks such as data storage, retrieval, modification,
                    and maintenance, while providing data integrity, security, and efficient data manipulation. Database
                    systems are designed to handle large amounts of structured data and offer features like data
                    modeling, query languages, transaction management, and more.</li>
                <li><b>File system</b> : A File System is the software component of an operating system that manages the
                    storage and organization of files on storage devices. It defines the structure for storing files,
                    directories, and metadata related to each file, such as size, permissions, and location. File
                    systems provide a way for users and applications to access and manage files stored on various
                    storage media. They're generally simpler than database systems and are primarily focused on managing
                    individual files rather than structured data relationships.</li>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Disadvantages of file system</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data redundancy and inconsistency : </b> In file systems, the same data may be stored in
                        multiple files, leading to redundancy. This redundancy can result in inconsistencies when
                        updates are made to the same data in different files, causing discrepancies and errors.</li>
                    <li><b>Difficulty in Accessing Data : </b> Retrieving specific data from file systems can be
                        challenging. Users need to know the exact location and structure of files, leading to complex
                        code and slower data access times.</li>
                    <li><b>Data isolation : </b> In file systems, data is scattered across various files and formats,
                        making it hard to maintain consistency and integrity. Changes to data structures can lead to
                        issues in multiple places.</li>
                    <li><b>Integrity problems : </b> Maintaining data integrity (accuracy and consistency) is difficult
                        in file systems since there is no centralized control over data. Unauthorized changes and errors
                        can occur easily.</li>
                    <li><b>Atomicity problems : </b> File systems lack mechanisms to ensure atomicity, which is the
                        property that guarantees a series of operations are treated as a single, indivisible unit. If an
                        operation fails midway, there's no way to ensure the database is left in a consistent state.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Concurrent access anomalies : </b> In file systems, concurrent access to data by multiple
                        users can lead to inconsistent outcomes. Race conditions and conflicts can arise, causing
                        incorrect or unexpected results.</li>
                    <li><b>Security problems : </b> File systems have limited security features. Unauthorized access to
                        files and data can occur, leading to potential data breaches and privacy violations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The above mentioned disadvantages of file system are advantages of Database system</p>
                <h3>Advantages of Database system</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data Redundancy and Inconsistency Resolution:</b> DBMS minimizes redundancy through
                        normalization, which eliminates data duplication. Centralized control ensures consistent
                        updates, reducing inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li><b>Efficient Data Access:</b> DBMS provides query optimization and indexing techniques, making
                        data retrieval more efficient. Users can use a common query language to access data, simplifying
                        the process.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Integration:</b> DBMS integrates data in a centralized repository, enabling data
                        isolation and easier management. Changes to data structures can be made systematically.</li>
                    <li><b>Data Integrity Enforcement:</b> DBMS enforces data integrity through constraints, triggers,
                        and validation rules. It ensures that data remains accurate and consistent.</li>
                    <li><b>Atomicity and Transaction Management:</b> DBMS ensures atomicity by using transactions. If a
                        transaction fails, the database can be rolled back to a consistent state before the transaction
                        started.</li>
                    <li><b>Concurrency Control:</b> DBMS manages concurrent access through locking mechanisms and
                        isolation levels, avoiding conflicts and maintaining data integrity.</li>
                    <li><b>Enhanced Security:</b> DBMS offers robust security features, including user authentication,
                        access control, and encryption, safeguarding data from unauthorized access.</li>

            <h2>What is RDBMS</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.</li>
                <li>RDBMS is a database management system that is based on the relational model as introduced by Dr. E.
                    F. Codd.</li>
                <li>RDBMS stores data in the form of relational tables.</li>
                <li>An important feature of relational system is that a single database can be spread across several
                    tables.</li>
                <li> All modern database management system like SQL, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft
                    access are based on RDBMS.</li>
                <li> A relational database is the most commonly used database. It contains several tables and each table

                            <li>"The sequence of rows is insignificant" refers to the idea that the order in which rows
                                are stored or retrieved from a table does not inherently carry any meaning or
                                significance. In other words, the arrangement of rows in a table doesn't affect the
                                correctness or interpretation of the data. This property is a fundamental characteristic
                                of relational databases and is often referred to as "unordered" or "set-oriented" data

                <li>In 1985, Dr. Codd published a list of 12 rules that defines an ideal relational database and has
                    provided a guideline for the design of all relational database management system.</li>
                <li>Dr. E. F. Codd's rules, also known as Codd's 12 rules, laid the foundation for defining and
                    evaluating relational database management systems (RDBMS). These rules serve as guidelines for
                    ensuring the effectiveness and integrity of relational databases.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>All information in the database is to be represented in a tabular form.</li>
                        <li>Data is stored in tables consisting of rows and columns, ensuring a clear and structured
                            representation.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Each data value in the database is guaranteed to be accessible using a combination of the
                            table name, primary key value, and column name.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The DBMS must allow representation of missing or unknown data using a special value called
                            "null."</li>
                        <li>Ensures consistent handling of missing information and prevents confusion between actual

                            as data dictionary, which can be accessed by authorized users.</li>
                        <li>Users can use the same query language to access the catalog which they use to access the
                            database itself.</li>

                        <li>The DBMS must support a comprehensive language for defining, querying, and manipulating
                            data.</li>
                        <li>SQL (Structured Query Language) is an example of such a language that provides a

                            declarative commands.</li>
                        <li>Users should be able to modify data without needing to specify the physical implementation

            <h2>Architecture in DBMS</h2>
            <p>There are two types of architecture in DBMS.
            <ol>
                <li>Application architecture</li>
                <li>Schema architecture</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Application Architecture</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The application architecture describes how software components are organized and interact to
                        support the functionality of an application.</li>
                    <li>DBMS design depends on its architecture, which dictates how data is stored, accessed, and
                        managed within a database management system.</li>
                    <li>The basic client/server architecture is used to handle a large number of PCs, web servers,
                        database servers, and other components that are interconnected through networks.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Client-Server Model:</strong> In simple terms, the client-server model is a
                                computing
                                architecture where one system (the client) requests services or resources from another
                                system (the server). The client makes requests, and the server provides the requested
                                services, such as data retrieval or processing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>DBMS architecture depends on how users are connected to the database to fulfill their requests
                        and manage data effectively.</li>
                    <li>Types of Application Architecture
                        <ol>
                            <li>1-tier architecture: In this architecture, the entire application runs on a single
                                machine, with no distinction between the client and server.</li>
                            <li>2-tier architecture: This architecture separates the client interface from the database
                                server, allowing for better scalability and manageability.</li>
                            <li>3-tier architecture: In a 3-tier architecture, there are three distinct layers: the
                                presentation layer (client), the application logic layer (middle-tier), and the data
                                storage layer (database server). This approach offers enhanced flexibility and
                                scalability.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Database architecture can be categorized as <i>single-tier</i> or <i>multi-tier</i>. However,
                        from a logical standpoint, it typically falls into two main categories: 2-tier and 3-tier
                        architectures, as described above.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>1-Tier Architecture</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In 1-tier architecture, the database is directly available to the user. This means that users
                        can interact
                        directly with the Database Management System (DBMS) without any intermediary layers.</li>
                    <li>Any changes made in this architecture are directly reflected in the database itself. It does not
                        typically provide
                        user-friendly tools or interfaces for end-users to interact with the data.</li>
                    <li>1-tier architecture is commonly employed for local application development, where programmers
                        have direct access
                        to the database for quick response and efficient development. It is suitable for applications
                        with limited
                        complexity and user interaction requirements.</li>
                    <li>Advantages of 1-Tier Architecture:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Minimal latency: Direct access to the database results in minimal communication
                                overhead, ensuring fast
                                data retrieval and processing.</li>
                            <li>Complete control: Developers have full control over the database and can implement
                                custom solutions and
                                optimizations.</li>
                            <li>Simplicity: Well-suited for small-scale applications or prototypes where simplicity and
                                speed are
                                prioritized.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Disadvantages of 1-Tier Architecture:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lack of scalability: It is not suitable for applications that require scalability to
                                accommodate a large
                                number of users or complex data processing.</li>
                            <li>Security concerns: Direct database access can pose security risks if not properly
                                secured and controlled.</li>
                            <li>Limited user-friendliness: End-users may find it challenging to interact directly with
                                the database without
                                user-friendly interfaces.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>2-Tier Architecture</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2-tier architecture is akin to the basic client-server model. In this architecture, client-side
                        applications can
                        directly communicate with the database located on the server side. To facilitate this
                        interaction, APIs such as ODBC
                        (Open Database Connectivity) and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) are commonly used.</li>
                    <li>User interfaces and application programs run on the client side, making it the user's primary
                        interaction point
                        with the system.</li>
                    <li>The server side of the architecture is responsible for providing essential functionalities such
                        as query processing
                        and transaction management. It handles the execution of database operations requested by the
                        client, ensuring data
                        integrity and security.</li>
                    <li>Advantages of 2-Tier Architecture:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Efficient data access: Direct communication between the client and the database server
                                minimizes data access
                                latency, resulting in faster response times.</li>
                            <li>Simple architecture: It offers a straightforward and easy-to-understand design, making
                                it suitable for
                                applications with moderate complexity.</li>
                            <li>Controlled client environment: Developers have control over the client-side environment,
                                allowing for custom
                                user interfaces and application logic.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Disadvantages of 2-Tier Architecture:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Limited scalability: 2-tier architecture may struggle to handle a large number of
                                concurrent users and
                                complex data processing requirements, making it less suitable for enterprise-scale
                                applications.</li>
                            <li>Security challenges: Direct client-server communication can introduce security
                                vulnerabilities if not
                                properly secured and monitored.</li>
                            <li>Difficulties in maintenance: Changes or updates to the application often require
                                client-side modifications,
                                which can be challenging to manage, especially in a distributed environment.</li>
                        </ul>

                <p><b>3-Tier Architecture</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>3-tier architecture introduces an additional layer between the client and server, creating a
                        more structured and
                        scalable system.</li>
                    <li>In this architecture, the client cannot directly communicate with the database server. Instead,
                        the application on
                        the client-end interacts with an application server, which, in turn, communicates with the
                        database systems.</li>
                    <li>3-tier architecture is commonly employed for building large-scale web applications where
                        scalability,
                        maintainability, and security are paramount.</li>
                    <li>Key Components of 3-Tier Architecture:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Presentation Layer (Client):</strong> This layer is responsible for the user
                                interface and
                                interactions. It displays information to users and collects their input.</li>
                            <li><strong>Application Layer (Middle Tier):</strong> The middle tier, often referred to as
                                the application
                                server, contains the application's business logic. It processes user requests, performs
                                necessary
                                computations, and manages application functionality.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Layer (Server):</strong> The server-side layer houses the database systems
                                responsible for data
                                storage, retrieval, and management. It ensures data integrity and security.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Advantages of 3-Tier Architecture:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Scalability: 3-tier architecture can easily scale to accommodate a large number of users
                                and increased data
                                processing demands by adding more application servers or database servers.</li>
                            <li>Maintainability: Separation of concerns between layers simplifies maintenance and
                                updates. Changes to the
                                user interface or business logic can be made without affecting the entire system.</li>
                            <li>Security: By restricting direct access to the database and centralizing data management,
                                3-tier architecture
                                enhances security and access control.</li>

                    <li>Disadvantages of 3-Tier Architecture:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Complexity: The additional layer and intercommunication can introduce complexity,
                                increasing development and
                                maintenance efforts.</li>
                            <li>Latency: The extra layer can introduce some communication overhead, potentially leading
                                to slightly higher
                                response times compared to 2-tier architecture.</li>
                            <li>Cost: Implementing and maintaining a 3-tier architecture can involve higher initial
                                costs due to the
                                infrastructure required for multiple layers.</li>

            <h2>Data Independence</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Data independence is the ability to modify a schema definition at one level without affecting a
                    schema definition at the next higher level.</li>
                <li>Data independence is a fundamental advantage of database management systems (DBMS).</li>
                <li>Data independence can be categorized into two main types:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Physical Data Independence:</b></li>
                        <li><b>Logical Data Independence:</b></li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Physical Data Independence</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physical data independence is defined as the capacity to change the internal schema without needing
                    to alter the conceptual schema.</li>
                <li>For example, if changes are made to the storage size of the database system server, the conceptual
                    structure of the database remains unaffected.</li>
                <li>This type of data independence allows modifications to the physical schema without requiring changes
                    to application programs, ensuring flexibility in database design.</li>
                <li>Physical data independence effectively separates the conceptual and internal levels of the database
                    architecture.</li>
                <li>It primarily occurs at the logical interface levels where the database interacts with the
                    applications.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Logical Data Independence</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Logical data independence is the ability to modify the conceptual schema without necessitating the
                    rewriting of application programs.</li>
                <li>This characteristic enables changes to the conceptual schema without impacting the external schema
                    or user views of the data.</li>
                <li>Logical data independence serves to separate the external level from the conceptual level, allowing
                    for adaptability to evolving data requirements.</li>
                <li>For instance, if alterations are made to the conceptual view of the data, the user view of the data
                    remains unaffected, ensuring continuity in user interactions.</li>
                <li>Logical data independence primarily occurs at the user interaction level, maintaining user-facing
                    data consistency despite changes in the underlying schema.</li>

            <h2>E-R Model Concepts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a conceptual
                    data model used to represent the relationships between entities in a database.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Entities are objects or concepts in the real world that can be uniquely
                            identified and have attributes associated with them.</li>
                        <li>Relationships describe how entities are related to each other and can be
                            one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many.</li>
                        <li>Attributes represent properties or characteristics of entities.</li>
                        <li>ER diagrams use symbols like rectangles for entities, diamonds for
                            relationships, and ovals for attributes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> ER diagrams provide a clear and visual
                            representation of the data model, making it easier to understand and
                            communicate database designs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> ER modeling helps in achieving data
                            normalization by organizing data into separate entities and eliminating data
                            redundancy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Complex Relationships:</strong> It can represent complex
                            relationships between entities, such as those found in real-world scenarios
                            like customer orders, product catalogs, and employee hierarchies.</li>

                <li>The Entity-Relationship (E-R) model is a high-level data model.</li>
                <li>It is based on a perception of a real world that consists of collections of basic objects, called
                    entities,
                    and relationships among these objects.</li>
                <li>It develops a conceptual design for the database. It also provides a very simple and
                    easy-to-understand view

                <ul>
                    <li>An entity is a fundamental concept in the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model and represents a
                        specific thing or
                        object in the real world. Each entity is distinguishable from all other objects, meaning it has
                        a unique
                        identity.</li>
                    <li>Entities are used to model and describe real-world objects, such as people, places, things, or
                        concepts,
                        that are relevant to the domain being represented in a database.</li>
                    <li>Anything about which we store information, track data, or perform operations can be considered
                        an entity in
                        the context of database design and management.</li>
                    <li>Entities are characterized by their attributes, which are properties or characteristics that
                        define and
                        differentiate one entity from another.</li>
                    <li>In E-R diagrams, entities are typically represented by rectangles, and their names are displayed

                <ul>

                        attributes.
                        These entities belong to the same category or type within a particular domain.</li>
                    <li>Entity sets are used to organize and categorize entities in a database. For example, in a

                        entities.</li>
                    <li>Each entity set is defined by a common set of attributes that are applicable to all entities
                        within that
                        set. These attributes collectively describe the properties of the entities in the set.</li>
                    <li>Entity sets help simplify database design and management by allowing you to work with groups of
                        entities
                        that have similar characteristics and behaviors.</li>
                    <li>In E-R diagrams, entity sets are typically represented by rectangles similar to individual
                        entities but
                        often labeled with the plural form of the entity name to indicate that it represents a
                        collection of
                        entities.

                <h3>Types of Entity Sets</h3>
                <p>There are two primary types of entity sets in the Entity-Relationship (E-R) model, each with its own
                    characteristics and roles in database design:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Weak Entity Set &rarr;</b> A weak entity set is an entity set that depends on another entity,
                        known as the "owning" or "parent" entity, for its existence and uniqueness. Key features of weak
                        entity sets include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Dependency:</b> A weak entity set does not have a unique key attribute of its own,
                                meaning it cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone.</li>
                            <li><b>Representation:</b> In E-R diagrams, a weak entity set is typically represented by a
                                double rectangle, distinguishing it from strong entity sets.

                            </li>
                            <li><b>Example:</b> Consider a database for tracking library books. The "Copy" entity may be
                                a weak entity set because it depends on the "Book" entity for its identity, and copies
                                of different books might have the same attributes (e.g., copy number).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Strong Entity Set &rarr;</b> A strong entity set, in contrast, is an entity set that contains
                        sufficient attributes to uniquely identify each of its entities. Key features of strong entity
                        sets include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Uniqueness:</b> Each entity within a strong entity set can be uniquely identified by
                                its own attributes, typically with the help of a primary key attribute or a combination
                                of attributes.</li>
                            <li><b>Representation:</b> In E-R diagrams, a strong entity set is usually represented by a
                                single rectangle, indicating its self-sufficiency in terms of identity.

                                strong entity set because each student can be uniquely identified by a student ID or a
                                combination of attributes such as name and date of birth.</li>

                <p>EER diagram is introduced because there are some limitations of ER diagram to overcome them we use
                    EER diagram.</p>
                <p><b>Limitations of Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams</b></p>
                <p>Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams are valuable tools for visualizing the structure and
                    relationships
                    within a database. However, like any modeling technique, they have certain limitations that can
                    affect their ability to represent complex scenarios accurately. Below are some key limitations
                    of ER
                    diagrams:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>ER diagrams face challenges when it comes to representing class and subclass entities:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inheritance Hierarchy: ER diagrams may struggle to depict the hierarchical relationship
                            between a parent class and its subclasses effectively. While the parent class contains
                            general attributes and relationships, subclasses inherit properties from the parent but
                            also
                            have their unique attributes. Capturing this inheritance hierarchy can be complex.</li>
                        <li>Subclass to Subclass Relationship: When there is a relationship between two subclasses,
                            ER
                            diagrams may not provide a straightforward way to express this relationship. This
                            limitation
                            can make it challenging to model scenarios where subclasses interact with each other.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Additionally, ER diagrams cannot directly represent relationships between relationships:
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inter-Relationship Relationships: ER diagrams primarily focus on entities and their
                            relationships. They are less equipped to illustrate how relationships between entities
                            relate to each other. For example, expressing relationships like "a customer's
                            interaction
                            history with an order" can be challenging without additional notation or documentation.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <p>So, in summary, the main limitations of ER diagrams can be categorized into two key areas:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Difficulty in Representing Class and Subclass Hierarchies: ER diagrams may struggle to
                        clearly
                        depict inheritance hierarchies and relationships between subclasses.</li>
                    <li>Limited Support for Relationships Between Relationships: ER diagrams are primarily designed
                        for
                        entity-level relationships and may require additional techniques to represent complex
                        interactions between these relationships.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Despite these limitations, ER diagrams remain a valuable tool for database design, offering a
                    visual
                    and intuitive way to represent a wide range of database structures.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Generalization follows a "bottom-up approach" where two or more entities with shared

                                    superclass.</li>
                                <li>The primary purpose of generalization is to emphasize the similarities among

                    <p>The symbol of a triangle with "IS A" written on it is used in Extended Entity-Relationship (EER)
                        diagrams to represent the concept of "IS-A" relationships, also known as
                        "Generalization-Specialization" relationships.</p>

                    <p>Symbol Details:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Triangle Symbol:</b> The triangle is typically drawn as an arrowhead pointing from a
                            subclass (the specific entity or subtype) towards a superclass (the more general entity or
                            supertype). This arrowhead signifies the "IS-A" relationship, indicating that the subclass
                            "IS A" type of the superclass.</li>

                        <li><b>"IS A":</b> The "IS A" label written inside the triangle further emphasizes the nature of
                            the relationship. It signifies that instances of the subclass are instances of the
                            superclass. In other words, the subclass inherits properties (attributes and relationships)
                            from the superclass and can be treated as an instance of both the subclass and superclass.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <p>Let's consider an example to illustrate the use of the triangle symbol with "IS A":</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Suppose you have a superclass called "Vehicle."</li>
                        <li>You also have three subclasses: "Car," "Motorcycle," and "Bus."</li>
                        <li>You would draw a triangle arrowhead pointing from each of these subclasses (Car, Motorcycle,
                            Bus) towards the "Vehicle" superclass.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This notation indicates that each of these subclasses "IS A" type of "Vehicle." It means that a
                        Car "IS A" Vehicle, a Motorcycle "IS A" Vehicle, and a Bus "IS A" Vehicle. The subclasses
                        inherit common attributes and relationships from the superclass while having their own unique
                        properties.</p>

                    <p>In EER diagrams, "IS-A" relationships are essential for modeling class and subclass hierarchies,
                        providing a clear way to represent inheritance and specialization in a database schema.</p>

                        <li>In Specialization, an entity is divided into sub-entities based on their distinguishing

                        <li>Specialization follows a "Top-down approach" where a higher-level entity is specialized into
                            two or more lower-level entities.</li>

                        <li>Specialization can be applied repeatedly to refine the schema's design.</li>
                        <li>Specialization is often depicted by a triangle component labeled "IS A."</li>

                            "Motorcycle," each with its unique attributes and characteristics.</li>
                        <li>Typically, the superclass is defined first, followed by the subclass and their related

            <h2>Relational Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Relational Model is a foundational approach to organizing and managing data in databases.
                </li>
                <li>Data within the Relational Model is organized into two-dimensional tables, commonly known as
                    relations.</li>
                <li>Each table consists of rows and columns, where rows represent individual records or tuples, and
                    columns represent attributes or fields.</li>
                <li>One of the key principles of the Relational Model is that relationships between tables are
                    maintained by common fields, known as keys. These keys establish links between related data,
                    enabling the modeling of complex structures and dependencies.</li>
                <li>The Relational Model provides a structured and tabular representation of data, making it highly
                    suitable for a wide range of applications, including business, finance, healthcare, and more.
                </li>
                <li>It is characterized by its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use for querying and retrieving
                    data, primarily through the use of the Structured Query Language (SQL).</li>
                <li>The Relational Model is one of the most widely adopted and mature data models, with a rich
                    ecosystem of relational database management systems (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft
                    SQL Server, and Oracle Database.</li>

            <ul>

            <h2>Hierarchical Model</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The hierarchical model organizes data into a tree-like
                    structure with a single root node, to which other nodes are connected.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It involves adding child nodes to parent nodes, creating a parent-child
                            relationship.</li>
                        <li>It represents a one-to-many relationship, where one parent node can have multiple
                            child nodes, but each child node has only one parent.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong> The hierarchical model is commonly used to represent data like
                    food recipes, organizational hierarchies, and indexes in books or documents.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage in Food Recipes:</strong>
                    <p>The hierarchical model is a natural fit for representing food recipes. Here's how:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Root Node:</strong> The root node can represent the name of the dish or the
                            overall recipe.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parent Nodes:</strong> These represent major components or steps in the
                            recipe, such as "Ingredients," "Preparation," and "Cooking."</li>
                        <li><strong>Child Nodes:</strong> Child nodes further break down each major component.
                            For example, under "Ingredients," you can have child nodes for specific ingredients
                            like "Flour," "Eggs," and "Sugar."</li>
                        <li><strong>Sub-Child Nodes:</strong> You can continue nesting child nodes to represent
                            the quantities, measurements, and instructions for each ingredient or step. For
                            instance, under "Flour," you might have sub-child nodes for "1 cup" and "Sift the
                            flour."</li>
                        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Using a hierarchical model for recipes makes it easy to
                            follow the logical flow of a recipe, from the main dish to its individual components
                            and their details. This hierarchical structure is also useful for creating
                            interactive recipe applications, where users can expand and collapse sections for a
                            better cooking experience.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The network model is an extension of the hierarchical
                    model and is organized more like a graph structure.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Characteristics:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unlike the hierarchical model, the network model allows for nodes to have more
                            than one parent, creating a more flexible data structure.</li>
                        <li>It is designed for representing data where relationships between entities are
                            complex and interconnected.</li>
                        <li>Data in the network model is highly related, making accessing and querying the
                            data faster and more efficient.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The ability to have multiple parents for a node
                            allows for modeling complex relationships. For example, in a company database,
                            an employee can report to multiple supervisors or belong to multiple project
                            teams.</li>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Because data is closely related and interconnected,
                            accessing related information is faster and more efficient. Queries can navigate
                            through the network structure to retrieve data without the need for extensive
                            joins.</li>
                        <li><strong>Real-world Applications:</strong> The network model is well-suited for
                            representing various real-world scenarios, such as representing the structure of
                            computer networks, hierarchical organizations, or complex product assembly

                        records and sets, and relationships between data elements are represented graphically. It was a
                        popular database model in the early days of computing.</li>
                    <li>CODASYL Conference: CODASYL is the name of a conference that focuses on data system languages
                        and database management. This conference has played a significant role in shaping the field of
                        data management and has been a platform for discussing and developing data-related standards and
                        technologies.</li>

                        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> It consists of a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and
                            delete the database structure (e.g., tables, indexes, constraints) but not the data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Users:</strong> These commands are typically not used by general users accessing the
                            database via an application. They are used by database administrators (DBAs), database

                        <li><strong>Usage:</strong> DCL comprises SQL statements that control access to data and the
                            database as a whole.</li>
                        <li><strong>Privileges:</strong> In order to perform various operations in the database, such as
                            creating tables, sequences, or views, users need appropriate privileges.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Types of Privilege:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
