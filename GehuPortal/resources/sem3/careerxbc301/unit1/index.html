            <h2>Introduction to Reasoning</h2>
            <p>Reasoning is a fundamental skill in critical thinking and problem-solving.</p>
            <p>It involves the ability to think logically and draw conclusions based on available information.</p>
            <p>Reasoning allows us to analyze situations, evaluate arguments, and make informed decisions.</p>
            <p>Types of Reasoning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Deductive Reasoning:</b> Drawing specific conclusions from general premises.</li>
                <li><b>Inductive Reasoning:</b> Forming general conclusions from specific observations.</li>
                <li><b>Abductive Reasoning:</b> Making the best possible explanation based on available
                    evidence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Importance of Reasoning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhances problem-solving abilities.</li>
                <li>Supports effective communication and persuasive arguments.</li>
                <li>Aids in evaluating information and identifying biases.</li>
                <li>Useful in various fields, including science, law, and business.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Developing Reasoning Skills:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Practice critical thinking exercises.</li>
                <li>Analyze complex situations and break them down logically.</li>
                <li>Engage in debates and discussions to refine your reasoning abilities.</li>
                <li>Read diverse materials to broaden your perspective.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Conclusion:</p>
            <p>Reasoning is a vital skill that empowers individuals to think critically, solve problems, and make
                well-informed decisions. It's a cornerstone of success in various aspects of life and career.</p>

            <h2>Basic Concepts of Arrangement Based Questions</h2>
            <p>Arrangement based questions are a common type of problem-solving questions in various competitive exams
                and assessments. These questions test your ability to organize and arrange elements according to
                specific conditions.</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Deterministic Arrangement:</h3>
                <p>In deterministic arrangement, the positions of elements are fixed based on given conditions. You need
                    to
                    arrange elements in a specific order following the provided rules.</p>
                <p>Types of deterministic arrangements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Linear Arrangement: Elements are arranged in a straight line.</li>
                    <li>Vertical Arrangement: Elements are stacked vertically.</li>
                    <li>Circular Arrangement: Elements are arranged in a circular pattern.</li>
                    <li>Rectangular Arrangement: Elements are placed in rows and columns.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Non-deterministic Arrangement:</h3>
                <p>In non-deterministic arrangement, the positions of elements are not fixed, and multiple arrangements
                    are
                    possible. You need to explore all possible arrangements based on given conditions.</p>

                <h4>Practice Tips:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Read the conditions carefully and identify any fixed positions or constraints.</li>
                    <li>Draw diagrams or tables to visualize the arrangements.</li>
                    <li>Start with the fixed elements and use process of elimination to determine positions of other
                        elements.</li>
                    <li>Practice regularly to improve your speed and accuracy.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>Let's consider a linear arrangement with six people: A, B, C, D, E, and F. Conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A is to the left of B.</li>
                <li>C is between A and D.</li>
                <li>F is to the right of E.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Solving step by step:</p>
            <pre>
                <code>
- A _ _ D _ _
- A _ C D _ _
- A _ C D _ F
- A B C D _ F
            </code>
            </pre>
