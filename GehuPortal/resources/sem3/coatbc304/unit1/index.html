            <h2>Register Transfer Language (RTL)</h2>
            <p><b>Before learning Register Transfer Language we should know what are registers and why we are learning
                    them? What is its significane in digital machine?</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>We know that digital machine work with digital circuits.</li>
                <li>There are two types of digital circuits:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combinational circuits</li>
                        <li>Sequential circuits</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>We came across flip-flop in digital circuits and we know that a register is a group of flip-flop
                    which can store bit of information.</li>
                <li>Simple digital systems are frequently characterized in terms of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The register they contain.
                            <ul>
                                <li>When we say our computer is of 64 bit, we mean that the size of register which is
                                    used to pass instruction to the machine is of size 64 bits.</li>
                                <li>Instructions and data can be processed more efficiently.</li>
                                <li>Register is a very fast computer memory, used to store data/instruction
                                    in-execution.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A Register is a group of flip-flops with each flip-flop capable of storing
                                            one bit of
                                            information.</li>
                                        <li>An <b>n-bit register</b> has a group of n flip-flops and is capable of
                                            storing binary
                                            information of n-bits.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Hence, a register consists of a group of flip-flops and gates.</li>
                                <li>Use of Flip-Flops: Flip-flops store binary information, and they are controlled by
                                    logic gates to
                                    determine when and how new information is transferred into a register.</li>
                                <li>That's why we are learning about registers.</li>

                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The operations executed on the data in registers are called micro-operations e.g. shift, count,
                    clear
                    and load.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Some of the commonly used register are:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accumulator</b> : This is the most common register, used to store data taken out from the memory.
                </li>
                <li><b>General Purpose Registers</b> : This is used to store data intermediate results during program
                    execution. It can be accessed via assembly programming.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Special purpose registers:</b> Users do not access these registers. These registers are for computer
                system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>MAR</b> : Memory Address Register are those registers that holds the address for memory unit.
                </li>
                <li><b>MBR</b> : Memory Buffer Register stores instruction and data received from the memory and sent
                    from the memory.</li>
                <li><b>PC</b> : Program Counter points to the next instruction to be executed.</li>
                <li><b>IR</b> : Instruction Register holds the instruction to be executed.</li>

                    <li>We know CPU reads and write data on memory. So this address register is used to store memory
                        address of
                        data for CPU.</li>
                    <li>It picks data from memory like addresses, addresses stored in address register, AR gives the
                        address to memory, memory then decodes the addresses and then fetches the data from RAM.</li>

                        fetched from the computer's memory. When the CPU reads data from memory, it's stored in the MDR
                        before being processed. Similarly, when the CPU writes data to memory, it places the data in the
                        MDR before sending it to the memory. The MDR essentially acts as a temporary storage location
                        for data during memory read and write operations.</li>

                        It holds data that is being transferred between the CPU and an I/O device, such as a hard drive
                        or network interface. The MBR helps in coordinating data transfers between the CPU and I/O
                        devices, ensuring efficient communication and minimizing bottlenecks. It serves as a temporary
                        buffer to hold data that is moving between the CPU and external devices.</li>

                    <li>It is also called a Processor Register.</li>
                    <li>The accumulator register retrieves data from memory and temporarily stores it before
                        transferring it to the ALU. This intermediate step allows data to be efficiently accessed by the
                        ALU for various arithmetic and logical operations. By doing so, the processor optimizes
                        performance by minimizing direct memory access during calculations.</li>

            <p><b>Q-</b> Why there is a need to have a bus.
            <ul>
                <li>In a digital system with multiple registers, it's not feasible to create direct connections for data
                    and control lines between each pair of registers to allow them to directly load content from any
                    other register. This is why computer systems use a busâ€”a shared communication pathwayâ€”allowing
                    efficient data transfer among various components.</li>
                <li>A bus structure consists of set of common lines, one for each bit of a register through which binary
                    information is transfered one at a time. It have a control circuits to select which register is the
                    source, and which is the destination.</li>
                <li>This is how we are designing the bus systems from register to bus. Bus &larr; R

                    the outside environment and vice versa is known as Bus transfer. Similarly, the transfer of data
                    from the memory unit to the outside environment and vice versa is known as memory transfer.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>A three-state gate is a digital circuit that exhibits three states, two of which are signals
                        equivalent to logic 0 and 1, similar to a conventional gate. The third state is the
                        high-impedance state, which restricts the flow of input towards the output.</li>
                    <li>The high-impedance state behaves like an open circuit, which means that the output is
                        disconnected and does not have logical significance.</li>
                    <li>A three-state bus buffer has a control input that determines the output state. When the control
                        input is equal to 1, the output is enabled, and the gate behaves like a conventional buffer with
                        the output equal to the normal input. When the control input is 0, the output is disabled, and
                        the data goes into the high-impedance state, regardless of the value of the normal input.</li>

                <img src="../../images/selectiveset2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>Again, the two leftmost bits of B are 1s, so the corresponding bits of A are complemented. The
                        exclusive-OR micro-operation can be used to selectively complement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Selective Clear:</b> The selective clear operation clears to 0 the bits in A only where there are
                    corresponding 1s in B. For example &darr;</p>
                <img src="../../images/selectiveset3.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>Again, the two leftmost bits of B are 1s, so the corresponding bits of A are cleared to 0.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Mask Operation:</b> The mask operation is similar to the selective-clear operation except that the
                    bits of A are cleared only where there are corresponding 0s in B. The mask operation is an AND
                    micro-operation as seen from the following numerical example:</p>
                <img src="../../images/mask1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>The two rightmost bits of A are cleared because the corresponding bits of B are 0s. The two
                        leftmost bits are left unchanged because the corresponding bits of B are 1s.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Insertion Operation:</b> The insert operation inserts a new value into a group of bits. This is
                    done by first masking the bits and then ORing them with the required value. For example, suppose
                    that an A register contains eight bits, 0110 1010. To replace the four leftmost bits by the value
                    1001, we first mask the four unwanted bits:</p>
                <img src="../../images/mask2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>The mask operation is an AND micro-operation, and the insert operation is an OR micro-operation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Clear Operation:</b> The clear operation compares the words in A and B and produces an all-0's
                    result if the two numbers are equal. This operation is achieved by an exclusive-OR micro-operation,
                    as shown by the following example:</p>
                <img src="../../images/mask3.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>When A and B are equal, the two corresponding bits are either both 0 or both 1. In either case,
                        the exclusive-OR operation produces a 0. The all-0's result is then checked to determine if the
                        two numbers were equal.</li>

                <h3>Shift Micro-Operations</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shift micro-operations are used for the serial transfer of data. The contents of a register can
                        be shifted to the left or the right. There are three types of shifts: logical, circular, and
                        arithmetic.</li>
                    <li><b>A logical shift</b> is one that transfers 0 through the serial input. The symbols <b>shl</b>
                        and <b>shr</b> are used to show logical shift-left and shift-right micro-operations. For example
                        &darr;</li>
                    <img src="../../images/shl.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                    <li><b>The circular shift</b> (also known as a rotate operation) circulates the bits of the register
                        around the two ends without loss of information. This is accomplished by connecting the serial
                        output of the shift register to its serial input. We will use the symbols <b>cil</b> and
                        <b>cir</b> for the circular shift left and right, respectively.
                    </li>
                    <img src="../../images/circularshift.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                    <li><b>An arithmetic shift</b> shifts a signed binary number to the left or right. An arithmetic
                        shift-left multiplies a signed binary number by 2. An arithmetic shift-right divides the number
                        by 2. Arithmetic shifts must leave the sign bit unchanged because the sign of the number remains
                        the same when it is multiplied or divided by 2.
                        <ul>
                            <li>The arithmetic shift-right leaves the sign bit unchanged and shifts the number to the
                                right. Thus, Rn-1 remains the same, Rn-2 receives the bit from Rn-1. The bit in R0 is
                                lost. The arithmetic shift-left inserts a 0 into R0 and shifts all other bits to the
                                left. The initial bit of Rn-1 is lost and replaced by the bit from Rn-2.</li>

                    <li>We have learned about the operations that are performed by ALU (Arithmetic Logical Unit) module
                        of processor like
                        shift operation, arithmetic, logic, etc.</li>
                    <li>ALU basically perform operation when data and instructions (add, sub) are given to it and then it
                        generates result.</li>
                    <li>The ALU by itself can't finish the job, as it needs the right instructions for calculating
                        results in a specific time. This is why another part inside the processor, called the control
                        unit, is necessary. The control unit makes sure the timing and control signals are all set.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Why CU is important?</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Control Unit (CU) plays a vital role in the computer's operation.</li>
                    <li>When data arrives for processing, it can't directly enter the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) as the
                        ALU doesn't have the ability to understand what to do with the data without instructions.</li>
                    <li>This is how it functions: Initially, the data is stored in registers, which act as temporary
                        holding areas. Following that, the Control Unit (CU) becomes active.</li>
                    <li>The Control Unit generates instructions that guide the ALU's actions:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Retrieving data from the registers</li>
                        <li>Activating specific circuits within the ALU for precise time intervals, facilitating
                            calculations</li>
                        <li>Providing the final calculated result once the computations are finished.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Basically CU is that module of a processor which controls all the operations happening inside
                        the processor.</li>

            <h2>Instruction Formats</h2>
            <p>A computer program is a collection of instructions. Each instruction is represented using an instruction
                format, which helps the computer understand how to execute the instruction.</p>
            <p>Instruction formats are primarily classified into three fields:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Address Field:</strong> This field specifies the address of the operand. Operand data can
                    reside either in memory or registers, so the address field indicates the memory location or register
                    where the operand can be found.</li>
                <li><strong>Opcode Field:</strong> The opcode field specifies the operation to be performed. Different
                    instructions have different opcodes that define their specific operations. These operations can
                    include data transfer, data manipulation, program control, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Mode Field:</strong> The mode field specifies how an effective address is determined for the
                    operand. In computer operations, we often need to work with data located at specific addresses, and
                    the mode field helps determine how to calculate or locate that address.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Our main focus here is on the Address Field, which plays a crucial role in specifying where data resides
                or how to calculate an effective address.</p>

            <h3>Address Field Organizations</h3>
            <p>Based on the number of addresses required by an instruction, there are three primary types of
                organizations:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Single Accumulator Organization:</strong> In this organization, the accumulator is implicit,
                    meaning it doesn't need to be explicitly specified in the instruction. The choice of accumulator
                    usage depends on the specific instruction being executed. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>CLA</strong> (Clear Accumulator): This instruction doesn't contain any operands, and
                            when executed, it automatically clears the content of the accumulator.</li>
                        <li><strong>CMA</strong> (Complement Accumulator): Similarly, the accumulator is implicit here, and
                            executing this instruction complements the content of the accumulator.</li>
                        <li><strong>ADD X</strong>: While we perform addition on two operands, in this case, <strong>X</strong>
                            represents a memory location, and the accumulator is the implicit second operand. So,
                            executing this instruction adds the content of the accumulator to the memory word at address
                            <strong>X</strong> (i.e., <strong>AC + M[X]</strong>).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>General-Purpose Register Organization:</strong> In this organization, instructions can
                    contain multiple addresses, which can refer to registers or memory operands. This allows for a wide
                    range of combinations. For example:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>ADD R1, R2, R3</strong>: This instruction adds the contents of registers <strong>R2</strong>
                            and <strong>R3</strong> and stores the result in <strong>R1</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>ADD R1, R2</strong>: Here, <strong>R1</strong> serves as both the source and destination
                            registers.</li>
                        <li><strong>MOV R1, R2</strong>: This instruction copies the content of <strong>R2</strong> into
                            <strong>R1</strong>.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>ADD R1, X</strong>: In this case, <strong>X</strong> represents a memory location, and the
                            operation adds the content of register <strong>R1</strong> to the memory word at address
                            <strong>X</strong> (i.e., <strong>R1 + M[X]</strong>).
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Stack Organization:</strong> Stack organization involves instructions like <code>PUSH</code>
                    and <strong>POP</strong>, which we will discuss further in the context of zero-address instructions.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Instructions can be classified into five types based on the number of operands they use:
            <ol>
                <li>Three-Address Instruction</li>
                <li>Two-Address Instruction</li>
                <li>One-Address Instruction</li>
                <li>Zero-Address Instruction</li>
                <li>RISC-Address Instruction</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Three-Address Instruction</h3>
                <p>Consider the expression: X = (A + B) * (C + D)</p>
                <p>We can represent this expression using three-address instructions, which means each instruction
                    contains three addresses, which can be either registers or memory addresses.</p>

                <h3>One-Address Instruction</h3>
                <p>In the one-address instruction format, we use instructions like "LOAD" (load a memory word into the
                    accumulator) and "STORE" (store the accumulator into memory):</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
LOAD A          ; AC <- M[A]
ADD B           ; AC <- AC + M[B]
STORE T         ; M[T] <- AC 
LOAD C          ; AC <- M[C]
ADD D           ; AC <- AC + M[D]
MUL T           ; AC <- AC * M[T]
STORE X         ; M[X] <- AC
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <h3>Zero-Address Instruction</h3>
                <p>In zero-address instructions, we utilize a stack for computation. This type of instruction set
                    includes operations like "PUSH" and "POP" for stack manipulation, as well as arithmetic operations
                    such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. To represent the given expression using
                    zero-address instructions, we need to convert the expression into postfix notation.</p>
                <p>Here are some rules for postfix notation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If it's an operand, push it onto the stack.</li>
                    <li>If it's an operator, pop the last two operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push
                        the result back onto the stack.</li>
                    <li>Postfix notation eliminates the need for parentheses because the order of operations is
                        unambiguous. Operators are always applied to the last two operands on the stack.</li>
                    <li>When evaluating postfix expressions, operators are processed from left to right.</li>
                    <li>The stack is used to hold both operands and intermediate results during the computation.</li>
                </ul>
                <pre>
                    <code>
Postfix Expression: AB+CD+*

PUSH A          ; Push operand A onto the stack
PUSH B          ; Push operand B onto the stack
ADD             ; Pop the last two operands (A and B), add them, and push the result onto the stack
PUSH C          ; Push operand C onto the stack
PUSH D          ; Push operand D onto the stack
ADD             ; Pop the last two operands (C and D), add them, and push the result onto the stack
MUL             ; Pop the last two operands (result of C+D and result of A+B), multiply them, and push the result onto the stack
POP X           ; Pop the final result from the stack and store it in memory location X

                <li>We know that every program is a collection of instructions, where each instruction is executed with
                    the help of instruction cycle.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instruction cycle is divided into 4 phases.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Fetch the instruction from the memory.</li>

            <p>After going through each phases for the first instruction, the CPU again start from the phase 1 for
                the second instruction and so on. This way all the program are to be executed. The last instruction
                of any program is HALT (program execution is over).</p>

                <li>What is Sequence Counter (SC)?
                    <ul>
                        <li>If we apply the clock pulse in sequence counter for the first time we will get timing signal
                            called T<sub>0</sub>. If we apply another clock pulse we will another timing signal
                            (T<sub>1</sub>) and so on.</li>

                        from the memory and that instruction should be loaded into instruction register (IR stores the
                        instruction), now for the next instruction to be executed we have to increment the PC.

                                gigahertz (GHz), which means they can perform a large number of operations per second.
                                On the other hand, many external devices, such as keyboards, hard drives, or network
                                interfaces, operate at significantly slower speeds. For instance, hard drives might
                                transfer data at rates of megabytes per second, which is much slower compared to the
                                billions of instructions the CPU can execute in the same amount of time.</li>
                            <li>Without Interrupts: Imagine a scenario where the CPU is executing a program and needs to
                                read data from a slow external device. If interrupts were not used, the CPU would need
                                to continuously poll (check) the external device to see if it has data ready for
                                processing. This polling would involve the CPU repeatedly asking the device, "Are you
                                ready yet?" and waiting for a response.</li>
                            <li>Wasted CPU Time: During this waiting period, the CPU would not be doing anything
                                productive. It would spend a significant portion of its time repeatedly checking the
                                device's status instead of executing useful instructions from the program it's supposed
                                to run. This results in a wastage of CPU processing power and efficiency.</li>
                            <li>Interrupt Solution: Here's where interrupts come into play. When an external device has
                                data ready for processing or an event occurs that requires CPU attention, the device
                                sends an interrupt signal to the CPU. The CPU then temporarily suspends its current
                                activities, saves its current state, and switches to the appropriate interrupt handler
                                routine to deal with the event.

                                This allows the CPU to efficiently manage its time. It doesn't need to constantly poll
                                devices. Instead, it can continue executing other tasks or programs until an interrupt
                                occurs. When an interrupt happens, the CPU switches to handling that interrupt,
                                processes the required data or event, and then resumes its previous activities.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>In essence, interrupts allow the CPU to be more productive by not wasting time waiting for
                        slower devices. Instead, it can work on multiple tasks in parallel, efficiently responding to
                        external events and data availability as needed.</li>

                <h3>How to handle multiple interrupts</h3>

                </ul>
                <p><b>Method 1 : Disable multiple interrupts</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>is a technique used in interrupt handling to temporarily prevent the CPU from responding to
                        additional interrupts while it is already processing an interrupt. This approach ensures that
                        the CPU completes the current interrupt handling routine without being interrupted by other
                        interrupt requests. Once the current interrupt is fully handled, the CPU re-enables interrupts,
                        allowing it to respond to new interrupt requests.</li>
                    <li>Here sequential execution of interrupt occurs &darr;</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/interrupt3.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Advantages : </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Predictable Handling: Disabling multiple interrupts ensures that the CPU completes the
                                current interrupt handling routine without being interrupted by other interrupts. This
                                can lead to more predictable and deterministic behavior in critical tasks.</li>
                            <li>Simplicity: This approach can simplify the interrupt handling process, making it easier
                                to manage and debug interrupt-related code.</li>
                            <li>Avoids Race Conditions: By preventing multiple interrupts from occurring simultaneously,
                                the CPU avoids potential race conditions where multiple interrupts might interact in
                                unexpected ways.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Disadvantages : </b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Interrupt Latency: While the CPU is handling an interrupt with interrupts disabled, it
                                cannot respond to other interrupts, potentially causing a delay in handling
                                time-sensitive events.</li>
                            <li>Unresponsiveness: If an interrupt with high priority occurs while interrupts are
                                disabled, the system might not be able to promptly respond, leading to reduced system
                                responsiveness.</li>
                            <li>Interrupt Priority: Disabling multiple interrupts can prevent lower-priority interrupts
                                from being serviced during the execution of a higher-priority interrupt, potentially
                                affecting the overall system performance.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Method 2 : Give priority to interrupt</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "give priority to interrupt" technique is an interrupt handling strategy in computer systems
                        where different interrupts are assigned different priority levels. When multiple interrupts
                        occur simultaneously or in quick succession, the system responds to the interrupt with the
                        highest priority first. This approach ensures that critical or time-sensitive events are
                        addressed promptly, even if other interrupts are pending.</li>
