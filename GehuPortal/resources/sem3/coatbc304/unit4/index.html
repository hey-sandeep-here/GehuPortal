        <ul>
            <li>Welcome to the world of Input-Output Organization! This chapter is all about how your computer
                communicates with the outside world, especially through devices like keyboards, mice, and printers—these
                are known as peripheral devices. Think of them as the helpers that make your computer do things. Ever
                wondered how your computer understands when you click your mouse or type on your keyboard? That's
                exactly what we're going to explore. We'll break down the basics of Input-Output Organization,
                demystifying the process of how your computer interacts with these peripheral devices. So, let's dive in
                and uncover the secrets behind the scenes of how your digital world connects with the physical through
                these devices!</li>

            <h2>Peripheral Devices</h2>
            <p>These are nothing but input/output device which are connected to the computer. These are of 3 types
            <ol>
                <li>Input Peripheral</li>
                <li>Output Peripheral</li>

                <h3>Input Peripheral</h3>
                <p>Input peripherals play a crucial role in providing the computer with the necessary data to
                    process. These devices serve as the bridge between human interaction and the digital realm,
                    allowing users to input information effectively. Examples of input peripherals include
                    keyboards, mice, and scanners.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Keyboard:</strong> When we use a keyboard, we press keys, each of which corresponds
                        to a meaningful character in the ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
                        set. ASCII uses 7 bits, enabling the representation of 128 characters. Among these, 94 are
                        printable, and 34 are non-printable. Within the printable characters, 26 represent the
                        alphabet, 10 represent digits (0-9), and 32 include upper and lower case letters along with
                        special symbols.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficiency Considerations:</strong> Recognizing that input devices like keyboards
                        operate at a slower pace compared to the speed of the CPU, computers implement the concept
                        of multiprogramming. This technique ensures that the CPU remains busy and efficient, even
                        when dealing with input devices that are inherently slower due to human operation.</li>

                <p>Output peripheral devices play a crucial role in presenting information to users in a
                    comprehensible format. These devices are primarily designed to display data processed by the
                    computer, offering a tangible output. Among the most commonly used output peripherals are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Monitors:</strong> Monitors serve as visual displays, presenting a wide range of
                        information, from text and images to videos. They are the primary output interface for users
                        to interact with the digital content produced by the computer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Printers:</strong> Printers, on the other hand, provide a physical representation of
                        digital data. They convert electronic documents into tangible, printed copies, making
                        information accessible beyond the digital realm.</li>

                <h3>Input-Output Peripheral Devices</h3>
                <p>Input-Output (I/O) peripheral devices are the versatile components that facilitate both the input
                    and output of data between the computer and its external environment. These devices serve as
                    bidirectional bridges, enabling communication between the user and the computer system. Examples
                    of Input-Output peripheral devices include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Touchscreen Displays:</strong> Touchscreens are multifunctional devices that allow
                        users to input data by touch and receive visual output simultaneously. They find
                        applications in devices like smartphones, tablets, and interactive kiosks.</li>
                    <li><strong>External Hard Drives:</strong> External hard drives not only store data but also
                        provide a means for users to input information into the computer (by transferring files to
                        the computer) and receive output (by accessing stored data).</li>

            <h2>Input-Output Interface</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The Input-Output (I/O) interface serves as the crucial link for transferring data between the
                    internal storage of a computer and external I/O devices. Establishing a communication link between
                    peripherals and the CPU is essential for seamless data exchange.</li>
                <li>In most cases, the CPU cannot directly access I/O devices due to fundamental differences between the
                    CPU and these devices. To overcome these disparities, an I/O interface is employed.</li>
                <li>By utilizing input and output interfaces, the CPU can effectively communicate with I/O devices,
                    bridging the gap and facilitating the exchange of information.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Differences between CPU and IO devices </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Peripherals operate on electromechanical and electromagnetic principles, differing significantly
                        from the functioning of the CPU and memory. Consequently, a signal conversion is necessary to
                        facilitate communication.</li>
                    <li>While CPU processing speed is considerably faster than that of IO devices, the latter are
                        relatively slower. To synchronize these disparate speeds, an interface is employed to ensure
                        smooth and efficient data transfer.</li>
                    <li>The data format for IO devices is typically in bytes, whereas the CPU executes instructions in
                        the form of words.</li>
                    <li>Input-Output operations transfer data in a serial manner, whereas the CPU executes instructions
                        in parallel, handling multiple instructions simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Each peripheral device has unique operational characteristics that must be controlled to prevent
                        interference with the operations of other peripherals. Coordination and control are essential to
                        ensure smooth system functionality.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To address and reconcile these differences, computer systems incorporate special hardware components
                    known as interface units. These interface units serve as intermediaries between the CPU and
                    peripherals, managing the communication and ensuring compatibility between the diverse elements of
                    the computing system.</p>

            <h3>I/O Bus and Interface Modules</h3>
            <p>In the diagram below, you can see the communication link between the processor and peripherals. This
                link is facilitated by the I/O bus, which includes data lines, address lines, and control lines.
                Each peripheral device is equipped with its own interface unit, and these interfaces serve crucial
                functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Decoding:</strong> The interface unit decodes the address and control signals received
                    from the CPU, understanding the instructions for the peripheral.</li>
                <li><strong>Management:</strong> It oversees and manages the operation of the peripheral device,
                    ensuring its functions as intended.</li>
                <li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Using buffers, the interface unit synchronizes the speed of
                    the CPU with that of the peripheral, facilitating smooth data transfer.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/peripheral1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
            <p>The I/O bus connects to all peripheral interfaces. To communicate with a specific device, the
                processor sends the device's address through the address lines. Each interface checks the incoming
                address against its own, activating the pathway between the bus lines and the designated device. If
                a peripheral's address doesn't match, its interface becomes inactive. The processor then sends
                control signals through the control lines and data through the data lines.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Processor Commands:</strong> The processor can generate four types of commands for
                    peripherals:
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Control Command:</strong> Instructs the device on what action to perform and how
                            to execute it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Status Command:</strong> Checks and reports the current condition or status of
                            the device.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Output Command:</strong> Initiates the transfer of data from the device to
                            the processor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Input Command:</strong> Prompts the device to take data from the data bus
                            and store it in its buffer.</li>
                    </ol>

            <h3>I/O Bus versus Memory Bus</h3>
            <p>The processor employs the I/O bus to communicate with peripherals, while the memory bus facilitates
                communication between the processor and memory. Both the I/O bus and memory bus share similar
                components, including data lines, address lines, and read/write control lines. The utilization of
                these buses can take different forms, and there are three main ways in which the I/O bus and memory
                bus can be configured:</p>

            <p><strong>1. Separate Buses:</strong> In this configuration, two distinct buses are employed—one
                dedicated to memory and the other to I/O operations. This approach ensures independent communication
                pathways, minimizing potential conflicts between memory and I/O processes. See the illustration
                below for a visual representation.</p>
            <img src="../../images/peripherals2.svg" alt="" class="wb">

            <p><strong>2. Common Bus with Separate Control Lines:</strong> An alternative configuration involves
                using a single bus for both memory and I/O operations. However, separate control lines are
                designated for each, allowing for independent management of memory and I/O processes. This approach
                optimizes resource sharing while maintaining control over the distinct functions. Refer to the
                diagram below for a clearer understanding.</p>
            <img src="../../images/peripherals3.svg" alt="" class="wb">

            <p><strong>3. Common Bus with Shared Control Lines:</strong> The third approach integrates both memory
                and I/O operations onto a single bus, and the control lines are shared between the two. This
                configuration simplifies the overall design by reducing the number of dedicated control lines. The
                diagram below illustrates this consolidated setup.</p>
            <img src="../../images/peripherals4.svg" alt="" class="wb">

            <p>Understanding the distinction between I/O and memory buses is crucial for designing efficient
                computer architectures. The choice of bus configuration depends on factors such as system
                complexity, performance requirements, and the need for resource optimization. By exploring these
                configurations, we gain insights into how computers manage data flow between the processor, memory,
                and peripherals, contributing to the overall functionality and performance of computing systems.</p>

            <h3>I/O Mapping A.K.A I/O Addressing A.K.A I/O Interfacing Technique</h3>
            <p>When the CPU shares a common bus system attached to both memory and I/O devices, it needs a way to
                differentiate between signals related to memory and those related to I/O. This is where Isolated I/O
                and Memory Mapped I/O come into play, providing distinct techniques for managing communication
                within the system.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Isolated I/O:</strong> In this method, separate control lines are designated for
                        memory and I/O operations. The CPU uses these control lines to efficiently manage the flow
                        of information, ensuring that data reaches the intended destination without interference.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Memory Mapped I/O:</strong> Unlike Isolated I/O, this technique employs a common
                        control line for both I/O and memory. The CPU relies on the specific addresses to determine
                        whether the operation involves regular memory or an I/O device. This simplifies the system's
                        design and programming, treating I/O devices as integral parts of the memory space.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Understanding these I/O mapping techniques is fundamental to designing efficient and cohesive
                computer architectures. The choice between Isolated I/O and Memory Mapped I/O depends on factors
                such as system complexity, performance requirements, and the desired level of integration between
                memory and I/O operations.</p>

            <h2>Data Transfer (Data Transmission)</h2>
            <p>Data transfer, also known as data transmission, refers to the process of sending data from one unit to
                another. This fundamental aspect of computing is categorized into two main types:</p>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>1. Parallel Transmission</h3>
                <img src="../../images/parallelcoa1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>Each bit in the data has its own dedicated path, allowing the entire message to be transmitted
                        simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>n bits must be transmitted through n separate wires, providing a faster data transfer rate.</li>
                    <li>Although faster, parallel transmission requires a significant number of wires, making it
                        suitable for short-distance applications where speed is critical, such as between the CPU and
                        memory (bus) or from the CPU to a printer.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li>Each bit of the message is sent in sequence, one at a time, through a single wire.</li>
                    <li>n bits are transmitted using only one wire, resulting in a slower but more cost-effective data
                        transfer process.</li>
                    <li>Serial transmission is commonly employed for longer distances, such as communication between the
                        CPU and I/O devices or between different computers.</li>
                </ul>

            <p>Understanding the distinctions between parallel and serial transmission is crucial in designing efficient
                communication systems, and the choice between them depends on factors such as distance, cost

                    <li>Bits are continuously transmitted to maintain frequency synchronization between both units.</li>
                    <li>Synchronous, in this context, means occurring at the same time, thanks to the presence of a
                        common clock.</li>
                    <li>This method is fast, ensuring efficient and timely data transmission.</li>
                    <li>However, it can be costly to implement due to the requirement for a synchronized clock system.

            <p>Understanding the characteristics of synchronous and asynchronous data transfer is crucial for designing

            <h2>Asynchronous Data Transfer & Its Types</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Asynchronous data transfer is employed when the speed of I/O devices does not align with the
                    processor, and the timing characteristics of the I/O device are unpredictable.</li>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Asynchronous data transfer between two independent communicating units
                    requires the transmission of control signals. These signals indicate the time at which data is being
                    transmitted and ensure proper coordination between the communicating units.</li>
                <li>Asynchronous data transfer is implemented using two distinct methods:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Strobe Control:</strong> In this method, the sender informs the receiver of an impending
                        data transfer by sending a strobe pulse. However, a challenge with this approach is that it
                        merely indicates that data is on the way, without confirming whether the receiver has
                        successfully received it. To address this limitation, a newer method called the handshaking
                        method was introduced.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Handshaking Method:</strong> In this method, when the sender intends to send data to the
                        receiver, it first notifies the receiver of the upcoming data transfer. In response, the
                        receiver sends an acknowledgment signal, confirming its readiness to receive the data. This
                        two-way confirmation ensures a more reliable and secure data transfer process compared to the
                        strobe control method.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <p>Asynchronous data transfer, with its reliance on control signals and handshaking methods, offers a
                flexible and robust solution for scenarios where the speed and timing characteristics of communicating
                devices may vary. The choice between strobe control and handshaking methods depends on factors such as
                the reliability and confirmation requirements of the data transfer process.</p>

                <div class="in">
                    <h3>Disadvantages of Strobe Control</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>One significant drawback of strobe control is that the source unit initiating the transfer
                            lacks confirmation of whether the destination unit has successfully received the data item
                            placed on the bus.</li>
                        <li>Conversely, when the destination unit initiates the transfer, it has no means of knowing
                            whether the source unit has indeed placed the data on the bus as intended.</li>
                        <li>This lack of acknowledgment introduces a potential challenge in ensuring the reliability and

                </div>

                <p>While strobe control provides a simple and efficient means of timing data transfers, the absence of
                    acknowledgment poses a limitation in guaranteeing the integrity of the communication process.
                    Overcoming this limitation often requires the adoption of more sophisticated techniques, such as
                    handshaking methods, to ensure a two-way confirmation of successful data transmission between

                        interface, it is commonly done using handshaking methods. This strategic choice in communication
                        techniques ensures an efficient and reliable data transfer process tailored to the specific
                        requirements and interactions between the central processing unit and the input/output

                    transferred between the CPU and I/O devices, the CPU primarily handles execution and stores some
                    data in its registers. However, the actual data transfer to I/O devices is facilitated through the
                    assistance of memory. Therefore, memory plays a crucial role, serving as an intermediate step when
                    performing data transfers from I/O devices. In this process, the CPU acts as an intermediary.</li>
                <li>Various modes exist for transferring data between the central computer and I/O devices, and
                    understanding these modes is integral to comprehending the intricacies of data transfer.</li>

                    <li>Each data transfer in Programmed I/O is initiated by an I/O instruction within the program,
                        typically to access registers or memory on a specific device.</li>
                    <li>Executing data transfers under program control demands continuous monitoring of I/O devices by

                <h3>DMA Controller</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>DMA enables I/O devices to transfer data directly to or from main memory without requiring CPU
                        intervention, effectively bypassing the CPU.</li>
                    <li>Between I/O devices and the CPU, there exists an interface, but between memory and I/O devices,
                        the DMA controller (or DMA channel) acts as the intermediary, creating a channel between main
                        memory and I/O devices. Devices such as magnetic disks, USB drives, network cards, graphics
                        cards, and sound cards, when connected via DMA, can achieve faster data transfer rates.</li>
                    <li>DMA finds applications in systems utilizing multicore architectures, particularly in scenarios
                        where intrachip data transfers are required.</li>
                    <li>Within the system bus, comprising address lines, data lines, and control lines connected to the
                        CPU, memory, and DMA controller, during DMA transfers, the CPU is temporarily disabled. While
                        the CPU typically controls the system bus, in DMA transfers, the DMA controller temporarily
                        borrows control of the system bus from the CPU to facilitate efficient data transfer between I/O
                        devices and memory.</li>

                <h3>How DMA makes CPU to go in idle state?</h3>
                <img src="../../images/dma2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <ul>
                    <li>To facilitate DMA's control over the bus system from the CPU, two signals are employed: Bus
                        Request (BR) and Bus Grant (BG).</li>
                    <li>When DMA desires full control of the bus system, it initiates the process by sending a Bus
                        Request (BR) signal through the bus request line.</li>
                    <li>Upon receiving the Bus Request (BR) signal, the CPU interrupts its ongoing tasks, relinquishes
                        control of all three components—data lines, address lines, and control lines—and enters a
                        high-impedance state. In this state, the bus behaves like an open circuit, disabling all signals
                        and buses.</li>
                    <li>To signal to the DMA that control has been transferred, the CPU sends a Bus Grant (BG) signal
                        through the bus grant line, indicating that the DMA now has authority over the buses. This
                        communication allows the DMA to use the buses to transfer data directly to memory.</li>
                    <li>Essentially, the two main signals used in this process are Bus Request (BR) and Bus Grant (BG).

                <h3>DMA Working</h3>
                <p>When an I/O device wishes to transfer data with main memory, the following steps
                    outline
                    the DMA
                    process:</p>
                <img src="../../images/dmacontroller2.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <p>In the diagram above, we have a detailed breakdown of the components involved in the Direct Memory
                    Access (DMA) process:
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>DS (DMA Select):</strong> The processor sets DS = 1 to activate DMA, initiating the DMA
                        process.</li>
                    <li><strong>RS (Register Select):</strong> The CPU uses this signal to select DMA registers for
                        storing values, such as the starting address and the number of words to be transferred.</li>
                    <li><strong>RD (Read) & WR (Write):</strong> These signals, Iri is used for reading and writing
                        purposes during the DMA operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>BR (Bus Request):</strong> DMA employs this line to send a request to the processor to
                        release the BUS system, indicating its need for control over the system bus.</li>
                    <li><strong>BG (Bus Grant):</strong> When the processor relinquishes control of the bus to DMA, it
                        sets BG = 1, signifying that the bus is now granted to the DMA controller.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interrupt:</strong> DMA uses this line to send a signal when data transfer is completed.
                        The processor can also use this line to check whether data transfer has been successfully
                        completed.</li>
                    <li><strong>DMA Request:</strong> I/O devices utilize this line to send a request to the DMA
                        controller, signaling the need for data transfer.</li>
                    <li><strong>DMA Acknowledgement:</strong> The DMA controller responds to I/O devices through this
                        line, acknowledging the receipt of the request and preparing for data transfer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Address Register:</strong> The processor stores the starting address of data in this
                        register, providing the necessary information for the DMA controller to locate the data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Word Count Register:</strong> The processor stores the total number of words to be
                        transferred in this register, allowing the DMA controller to determine the extent of the data
                        transfer operation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Register:</strong> The processor stores control signals in this register,
                        dictating various aspects of the DMA operation, such as the transfer mode and direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Bus Buffer:</strong> This component is employed to temporarily store data during
                        the DMA transfer process, ensuring efficient and synchronized data movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Bus:</strong> DMA utilizes this bus for the actual transfer of data between memory
                        and peripheral devices, facilitating high-speed and direct communication.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Now, let's delve into the operational sequence of the Direct Memory Access (DMA) process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initiation of Data Transfer Request:</strong> When an I/O device wishes to transfer
                        data, it sends a request to the DMA through the DMA request line.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bus Request to Processor:</strong> DMA, in response to the request, sends a bus request
                        (BR = 1) to the processor, requesting it to release control of the bus system (utilizing the BR
                        line).</li>
                    <li><strong>Processor's Response:</strong> Upon receiving the bus request, the processor stores its
                        current work, and then transmits essential information, such as the starting address and the
                        number of words to be transferred, to DMA. Subsequently, the processor relinquishes control of
                        the bus system and notifies DMA by setting the BG line to 1.</li>
                    <li><strong>DMA Acknowledgement and Data Transfer:</strong> Upon receiving the BG signal, DMA
                        activates the DMA acknowledgement line, informing the I/O device that it can commence data
                        transfer. The DMA controller initiates the actual data transfer process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decrementing Word Count:</strong> With each data transfer, the value of the Word Count
                        (WC) register is decremented by 1, keeping track of the progress of the data transfer operation.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Data Transfer Completion:</strong> When the WC register reaches 0, DMA sets BR = 0 and
                        sends an interrupt signal to the CPU, signaling the completion of the data transfer.</li>
                    <li><strong>CPU's Post-Transfer Actions:</strong> The CPU, upon receiving the interrupt, checks the
                        WC register. Since it is now 0, the CPU sets BG = 0, reclaiming control of the bus system for
                        its own operations.</li>

        </div>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Input Output Processor (IOP)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The IOP is an external processor designed to handle input and output tasks, communicating directly
                    with all I/O devices.</li>
                <li>It operates independently of the CPU and relieves the CPU of input-output responsibilities.</li>
                <li>Similar to a CPU, the IOP can fetch and execute its own instructions, perform arithmetic, logic,
                    branching, and code translation.</li>
                <li>The IOP provides a data transfer path between peripheral devices and the memory unit.</li>

                    <li>Peripheral devices often have different data formats than memory and CPU. The IOP is
                        responsible for structuring data words to match the required formats.</li>
                    <li>For example, it may receive 4 bytes from an input device and pack them into one 32-bit word

                    <li>The CPU initiates all operations, but I/O instructions are executed by the IOP.</li>

                            <li>The CPU sends the instruction to start I/O transfer by specifying the memory address
                                where the IOP should begin.</li>
                            <li>The CPU can proceed the other tasks while the IOP handles the I/O program.</li>
                            <li>After data transfer completion, the IOP sends an interrupt request to the CPU.</li>
                            <li>The CPU reads the IOP status, with the IOP placing the status report into a designated
                                memory location.</li>
