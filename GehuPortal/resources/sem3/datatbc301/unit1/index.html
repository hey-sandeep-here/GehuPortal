        </div>
        <div id="t4" class="wh">
            <h2>Physical Network Topology and Types:</h2>
            <p>The term physical topology refers to the way in which a network is laid out physically: I/O or more
                devices connect to a link; two or more links form a topology.</p>
            <p>There are four basic topologies possible: mesh, star, bus, and ring. And combining these we get hybrid.
            </p>
            <div class="in">
                <h3>Mesh Topology</h3>
                <p>In a mesh topology, every device has a dedicated point-to-point link to every other device. The term
                    "dedicated" means that the link carries traffic only between the two devices it connects.</p>
                <p>Node 1 must be connected to n - 1 nodes, node 2 must be connected to n – 1 nodes, and finally, node n
                    must be connected to n - 1 nodes. We need n (n - 1) physical links.</p>
                <p>However, if each physical link allows communication in both directions, the number of links needed is
                    n(n-1)/2.</p>
                <img src="../../images/meshtopo.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The use of dedicated links guarantees that each connection can carry its own data load, thus
                        eliminating the traffic problems that can occur when links must be shared by multiple devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>A mesh topology is robust. If one link becomes unusable, it does not incapacitate the entire
                        system.</li>
                    <li>There is the advantage of privacy or security. When every message travels along a dedicated
                        line, only the intended recipient sees it.</li>
                    <li>Point-to-point links make fault identification and fault isolation easy.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Amount of cabling and the number of I/O ports required.</li>
                    <li>The sheer bulk of the wiring can be greater than the available space (in walls, ceilings, or
                        floors) can accommodate.</li>
                    <li>The hardware required to connect each link (I/O ports and cable) can be prohibitively expensive.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Star Topology</h3>
                <p>In a star topology, each device has a dedicated point-to-point link only to a central controller,
                    usually called a hub.</p>
                <p>The devices are not directly linked to one another. Unlike a mesh topology, a star topology does not
                    allow direct traffic between devices. The controller acts as an exchange: If one device wants to
                    send data to another, it sends the data to the controller, which then relays the data to the other
                    connected device.</p>
                <img src="../../images/startopo.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A star topology is less expensive than a mesh topology.</li>
                    <li>In a star, each device needs only one link and one I/O port to connect it to any number of
                        others. This factor also makes it easy to install and reconfigure.</li>
                    <li>Far less cabling needs to be housed, and additions, moves, and deletions involve only one
                        connection: between that device and the hub.</li>
                    <li>Other advantages include robustness. If one link fails, only that link is affected. All other
                        links remain active.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The dependency of the whole topology on one single point, the hub. If the hub goes down, the
                        whole system is inoperative.</li>
                    <li>Although a star requires far less cable than a mesh, each node must be linked to a central hub.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Bus Topology</h3>
                <p>In a bus topology, the preceding examples all describe point-to-point connections. However, a bus
                    topology, on the other hand, is multipoint, where one long cable acts as a backbone to link all the
                    devices in a network.</p>
                <p>As a signal travels along the backbone, some of its energy is transformed into heat. Consequently, it
                    becomes weaker and weaker as it travels farther and farther along the cable.</p>
                <img src="../../images/bustopo.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bus topology offers ease of installation, making it a convenient choice for network setups.</li>
                    <li>A bus topology uses less cabling compared to mesh or star topologies, resulting in cost savings
                        and simplified network infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reconnecting devices and fault isolation in a bus topology can be challenging when issues arise,
                        potentially leading to network downtime.</li>
                    <li>A single fault or break in the bus cable can disrupt all data transmission, even between devices
                        located on the same side of the problem, affecting overall network reliability.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Ring Topology</h3>
                <p>In a ring topology, each device has a dedicated point-to-point connection with only the two devices
                    on either side of it. A signal is passed along the ring in one direction, from device to device,
                    until it reaches its destination.</p>
                <img src="../../images/ringtopo1.svg" alt="" class="wb">
                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>A ring topology is relatively easy to install and reconfigure, making it a flexible choice for
                        network setups. Fault isolation is simplified, making it easier to identify and resolve network
                        issues.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Unidirectional traffic can be a disadvantage in a ring topology, as data can only travel in one
                        direction around the ring. This limitation can impact network efficiency.</li>
                    <li>In a simple ring topology, a break in the ring, such as a disabled station or a cable fault, can
                        disable the entire network. This lack of redundancy can make the network vulnerable to
                        disruptions.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Hybrid Topology</h3>
                <p>A hybrid topology combines different network topologies within a single network infrastructure. For
                    example, a hybrid network can consist of a primary star topology with each branch connecting several
                    stations in a bus topology.</p>

                <h4>Advantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hybrid topologies offer greater flexibility in designing and customizing a network to meet
                        specific requirements. They can leverage the strengths of different topologies to optimize
                        network performance.</li>
                    <li>By combining topologies, fault tolerance and redundancy can be enhanced. If one part of the
                        network fails, it may not affect the entire system, improving overall network reliability.</li>
                    <li>Hybrid topologies can provide scalability, allowing the network to grow and adapt to changing
                        needs without requiring a complete overhaul.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing and managing a hybrid network can be complex and may require more extensive planning
                        and maintenance compared to single-topology networks.</li>
                    <li>The cost of implementing and maintaining a hybrid network can be higher due to the need for
                        different hardware and configurations to support multiple topologies.</li>
                    <li>Network troubleshooting and fault isolation may be more challenging in a hybrid topology, as
                        issues can arise from different interconnected topologies.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="in">
                <h3>Connecting Networks: Broadcast and Point-to-Point</h3>
                <p>After understanding topologies, we delve into different types of network connections.</p>
                <p><strong>Broadcast Network</strong></p>
                <p>In a broadcast network, all devices share the same communication medium and can send their messages
                    to all other devices on the network. It's like broadcasting a message to everyone.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Efficient for broadcasting information to all devices simultaneously.</li>
                    <li>Prone to congestion as all devices compete for the same channel.</li>
                    <li>Security concerns arise as all devices receive all messages.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Point-to-Point Network</strong></p>
                <p>In a point-to-point network, devices have dedicated communication links. This type of connection is
                    often seen in a more traditional client-server architecture.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offers direct, dedicated communication between devices.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced security since only intended recipients receive messages.</li>
                    <li>Requires more connections as the network expands.</li>
                    <li>Less efficient for broadcasting messages to all devices.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Understanding network topologies aids in deciding which connection type is suitable for different
                    scenarios.</p>

                        a single building or campus.</li>
                    <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> A larger network that spans across a city or

                <ul>
                    <li>High data transfer rates, suitable for resource-intensive applications.
                        <ul>

                                useful for "resource-intensive applications," which are like power-hungry superheroes of
                                the computer world. These applications, such as fancy video editing or intricate 3D
                                graphics, need a lot of computer muscle to do their jobs well. So, when a network boasts
                                high data transfer rates, it's like giving these power-hungry applications the speedway
                                they need to zip through their tasks without slowing down. It's like having a speedy

                            <li>Since LANs are designed to connect devices within a confined space, such as a single
                                building, campus, or office floor, the infrastructure required for deployment is
                                relatively contained. This focused coverage allows organizations to establish a network
                                environment without incurring the high costs associated with extensive cabling,
                                networking equipment, and other infrastructure elements needed for larger-scale
                                networks. As a result, LANs provide a cost-effective solution for facilitating seamless
                                communication and resource sharing among connected devices within the specified local
                                area.</li>

                            <li>Since it has a limited coverage area, a notable constraint of this system is its
                                unsuitability for connecting distant locations. The inherent design of this network
                                restricts its reach to a confined geographic area, such as a building or campus, making
                                it less practical for interconnecting devices across considerable distances. While the
                                system excels in providing localized connectivity, its limitation in terms of coverage
                                renders it less effective for scenarios requiring networking capabilities over extended
                                or remote locations. Organizations seeking to establish connections between
                                geographically distant sites may find alternative network solutions more appropriate for

                                this system is its expense when attempting to broaden coverage. The initial deployment
                                of this network may be cost-effective for its intended range, but scaling it to cover a
                                larger area can become financially burdensome. The need for additional infrastructure,
                                such as additional networking equipment, cabling, and other resources, contributes to
                                the increased expenses associated with expansion. As organizations strive to extend
                                network coverage to accommodate growing needs or reach new locations, the financial
                                implications of scaling up this system may necessitate careful consideration of budget

                                the scope of a metropolitan region,
                                such as a city or large campus, a MAN provides a broader network footprint. This
                                expanded coverage allows for connectivity across a more extensive geographical area,
                                facilitating communication and resource sharing for organizations with dispersed
                                locations within the metropolitan vicinity. While a MAN surpasses the confined coverage
                                of LANs, it still retains a regional focus, striking a balance between the localized
                                nature of LANs and the extensive reach of Wide Area Networks (WANs).</li>

                            <li>Another notable advantages of this system, is its enhanced data transfer capabilities.
                                Operating within the intermediate
                                scale between local and wide-reaching networks, a MAN offers faster data rates that
                                surpass those typically achievable in larger-scale WANs. This increased speed in data
                                transmission makes a MAN well-suited for applications that demand more robust and
                                efficient connectivity within a metropolitan area. By delivering accelerated data rates,
                                a MAN addresses the need for swift and reliable communication over a broader regional
                                scope, catering to the connectivity requirements of organizations with distributed

                            <li>A significant drawback of
                                this system, lies in the financial
                                investments required. The infrastructure necessary for deploying and maintaining a MAN
                                across a metropolitan area, including the installation of networking equipment, cabling,
                                and ongoing maintenance procedures, contributes to elevated costs. Unlike Local Area
                                Networks (LANs), which operate within a confined space, a MAN's intermediate scale
                                introduces complexities that can
                                escalate the initial setup expenses and the long-term maintenance overhead.
                                Organizations considering the implementation of a MAN must carefully weigh the cost

        <h1>Modes of Communication</h1>
        <p>Communication modes refer to the direction and flow of data transmission between devices in a network.
            <br>This determine how data transmission occurs between devices in terms of direction and availability of
            communication channels.
        </p>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Three primary modes of communications</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Simplex Mode:</b> In simplex mode, data can only flow in one direction. One device is the sender,
                    and
                    the other device is the receiver. The receiver can only receive data, and the sender can only send
                    data. There is no two-way communication. The receiver can't send data back to the sender on the same
                    channel. This mode is analogous to a one-way street. Examples of simplex mode include radio and
                    television
                    broadcasting, where the information flows from the broadcaster to the viewers, but viewers cannot
                    send any data back.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Half Duplex Mode:</b> In half duplex mode, data can flow in both directions, but not
                    simultaneously.
                    Devices can either send or receive data at any given time, but they cannot do both simultaneously.
                    Think of it as a walkie-talkie communication, where users must press a button to talk (send) and
                    release it to listen (receive).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Full Duplex Mode:</b> In full duplex mode, data can flow in both directions simultaneously.
                    Devices can
                    send and receive data at the same time, allowing for two-way communication. Full duplex
                    communication is commonly used in modern computer networks, where devices can both send and receive
                    data packets simultaneously.

        <h1>OSI model</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the
                functions of a communication or networking system into distinct layers. It was developed by the
                International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to ensure that different networking
                technologies could work together seamlessly. </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="wh">
            <h2>Why was the OSI Model Introduced?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model was introduced to address a fundamental problem in the
                    early days of computer networking: the lack of standardized communication protocols. As technology
                    advanced and different computer systems emerged, they often had their own unique ways of
                    transmitting and receiving data. This lack of uniformity created compatibility issues, making it
                    difficult for devices from different manufacturers to communicate effectively.</li>
                <li>The need for a standardized framework became apparent as networks expanded and connected globally.
                    The introduction of the OSI Model aimed to establish a common reference point for how networks
                    should be designed, operated, and interconnected, regardless of their underlying hardware or
                    software.</li>
                <li>Key Reasons for its Introduction:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Interoperability: The primary goal of the OSI Model was to enable seamless communication
                            between devices made by different manufacturers. By defining a set of protocols and
                            standards, it ensured that devices could understand each other's signals and data formats.
                        </li>
                        <li>Uniformity: Before the OSI Model, networking protocols varied widely. The model introduced a
                            structured framework with distinct layers, each responsible for specific functions. This
                            layering approach promoted consistency and simplified troubleshooting.</li>
                        <li>Global Connectivity: As networking expanded beyond individual organizations and crossed
                            national borders, the OSI Model became vital for enabling international data exchange. It
                            facilitated connections between networks with different technologies and protocols.</li>
                        <li>Framework for Development: The model provided a foundation for the development of new
                            networking technologies and protocols. Engineers and developers could design components to
                            align with the OSI layers, making it easier to create compatible and interoperable systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>Educational Tool: The OSI Model serves as an educational tool, offering a conceptual
                            framework for understanding how data moves through networks. It aids students,
                            professionals, and network administrators in comprehending complex networking concepts.</li>
                        <li>Evolution and Adaptation: While the OSI Model has evolved since its introduction, its core
                            concepts remain relevant. Its design influenced the development of real-world protocols like
                            TCP/IP, which underpins the modern internet.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In essence, the OSI Model was introduced to solve the challenges of disparate networking
                    technologies, promoting global connectivity, standardization, and interoperability. It continues to
                    be a foundational framework that shapes the design and operation of networks, ensuring effective
                    communication in today's interconnected world."</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>The OSI model consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific tasks in the communication process:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Physical Layer : </b> This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over a physical
                medium, such as cables or wireless signals. It focuses on characteristics like voltage levels, data
                rates, and physical connectors.</li>
            <li><b>Data Link Layer </b>: The data link layer is responsible for framing data into packets, error
                detection
                and correction, and managing access to the physical medium through protocols like Ethernet.</li>
            <li><b>Network Layer </b>: The network layer handles routing and forwarding of data packets. It
                establishes
                logical paths (routes) for data to travel between source and destination devices.</li>
            <li><b>Transport Layer </b>: This layer ensures end-to-end communication, managing data segmentation,
                flow
                control, and error recovery. It guarantees reliable data delivery between devices.</li>
            <li><b>Session Layer </b>: The session layer manages sessions (connections) between devices, including
                establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections. It also handles synchronization and data
                exchange coordination.</li>
            <li><b>Presentation Layer </b>: Responsible for data translation, encryption, compression, and other
                transformations to ensure that data sent from one device can be understood by the receiving device.
            </li>
            <li><b>Application Layer </b> : The topmost layer interacts directly with the end user and provides
                various
                application-level services such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.</li>

        <p>The OSI model is a reference framework, not an actual implementation. It serves as a guide for creating
            protocols and networking technologies that can work together. When data is transmitted between two
            devices in a network using the OSI model:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Data Generation </b>: The application layer on the sending device generates the data to be
                transmitted.</li>
            <li><b>Layer-by-Layer Processing </b>: As the data moves down the OSI layers, each layer adds its header
                or
                encapsulation, preparing the data for transmission.</li>
            <li><b>Transmission </b>: The data is transmitted over the physical medium through the physical and data
                link
                layers.</li>
            <li><b>Reception </b>: The receiving device processes the incoming data in reverse order, stripping off
                headers
                added by each layer.</li>
            <li><b>Delivery to Application </b>: The processed data is delivered to the application layer on the
                receiving
                device.</li>

        <p>The OSI model helps in understanding and troubleshooting networking protocols and technologies. It also
            aids in designing new protocols and technologies by providing a clear structure for communication
            functions. However, in practice, most networking models, like TCP/IP, combine some of the OSI layers for
            efficiency and practicality.</p>

                When data is being sent from a device (the sender) to another device (the receiver) over a network,
                the OSI model's seven layers play a role in both the sender's and receiver's networking stacks. Each
                layer adds its own header or encapsulation to the data as it moves down the stack on the sender's
                side, and then removes those headers in reverse order as the data moves up the stack on the
                receiver's side. Let's break down how the layers are stacked on both sides:

                processes occur within the OSI model. Initially, at the Physical Layer, the electrical signals
                representing your message travel through the physical medium, be it Wi-Fi or cellular networks. The Data
                Link Layer then packages the message into frames, adding addressing information and ensuring data
                integrity within your local network. Moving to the Network Layer, the optimal path for your message is
                determined for routing across the internet to your friend's device. At the Transport Layer, your message
                is divided into segments, adding sequence numbers to ensure proper reconstruction at the destination.
                The Session Layer establishes and manages the communication session between your Telegram app and the
                server, and the Presentation Layer encodes the data for transmission. Finally, at the Application Layer,
                your Telegram app initiates the message transfer, interacts with the user, and communicates with lower
                layers for sending and receiving messages, ultimately allowing seamless communication between you and
                your friend.</p>

            <h2>TCP/IP Protocol Suite</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI model. Therefore, the layers in the
                    TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly match those in the OSI model.</li>
                <li>The original TCP/IP protocol suite was defined as having four layers: host-to-network, internet,
                    transport, and application. However, when TCP/IP is compared to OSI, we can say that the
                    host-to-network layer is equivalent to the combination of the physical and data link layers. The
                    internet layer is equivalent to the network layer, and the application layer is roughly doing the
                    job of the session, presentation, and application layers with the transport layer in TCP/IP taking
                    care of part of the duties of the session layer.</li>
                <li>We will assume that the TCP/IP protocol suite is made of five layers: physical, data link, network,
                    transport, and application. The first four layers provide physical standards, network interfaces,
                    internet working, and transport functions that correspond to the first four layers of the OSI model.
                    The three topmost layers in the OSI model, however, are represented in TCP/IP by a single layer
                    called the application layer.</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="../../images/tcpipsuite.svg" alt="tcp" class="wb">
            <ul>
                <li>TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, each of which provides a specific
                    functionality. However, the modules are not necessarily interdependent.</li>
                <li>Whereas the OSI model specifies which functions belong to each of its layers, the layers of the
                    TCP/IP protocol suite contain relatively independent protocols that can be mixed and matched
                    depending on the needs of the system. This flexibility is a defining feature of TCP/IP.</li>
                <li>The term 'hierarchical' means that each upper-level protocol is supported by one or more lower-level
                    protocols. This arrangement ensures that different layers work together seamlessly to deliver data
                    across networks.</li>
                <li>At the transport layer, TCP/IP defines three protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), User
                    Datagram Protocol (UDP), and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). These protocols offer
                    different methods of data transmission, each tailored to specific requirements.</li>
                <li>At the network layer, the main protocol defined by TCP/IP is the Internetworking Protocol (IP). IP
                    is the backbone of the internet, responsible for routing and addressing packets of data across
                    networks. In addition to IP, there are other protocols that support data movement within this layer.
                </li>
                <li>The TCP/IP model's design allows for adaptability and efficiency. The independence of protocols
                    within its layers enables network architects to create solutions that suit various networking
                    scenarios. This modular approach, combined with the model's longevity and robustness, has
                    contributed to the enduring success of TCP/IP as the foundational protocol suite of the internet.

                <h3>Link Layer / Network Access Layer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Link Layer, also known as the Network Access Layer, deals with the physical transmission of
                        raw data bits over a physical medium, such as copper wires, optical fibers, or wireless
                        frequencies. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and procedural details for transmitting data
                        between devices.</li>
                    <li>At this layer, TCP/IP doesn't define any specific protocol but is designed to support a wide
                        range of standard and proprietary protocols that operate at these layers. This flexibility
                        allows TCP/IP to adapt to different network technologies and environments. A TCP/IP internetwork
                        can incorporate various types of networks, whether they're local-area networks (LANs) or
                        wide-area networks (WANs). This adaptability is one of the strengths of TCP/IP, as it enables
                        networks of different scales and types to interconnect seamlessly while utilizing the
                        appropriate protocols for their specific requirements.</li>

                <h3>Internet Layer</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Internet Layer, also known as the Network Layer, handles routing and forwarding of data
                        packets across networks. It's primarily based on the Internet Protocol (IP), which is
                        responsible for addressing, routing, and fragmenting data for transmission.</li>
                    <li>Within the Internet Layer, there are four essential supporting protocols:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Internet Protocol (IP):</b> IP is the backbone of the TCP/IP protocols, responsible
                                for transmitting data across networks. It operates as an unreliable and connectionless
                                protocol, providing a best-effort delivery service. This 'best effort' approach means
                                that IP doesn't perform error checking or tracking and assumes the underlying layers are
                                not perfect, aiming to get data to its destination without guarantees.</li>
                            <li><b>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP):</b> ARP associates a logical address with a
                                physical address, aiding in finding the physical address when the Internet address is
                                known.</li>
                            <li><b>Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP):</b> RARP helps a host discover its
                                Internet address when it only knows its physical address, often used when a computer is
                                connected to a network for the first time.</li>
                            <li><b>Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP):</b> ICMP is used for hosts and gateways to
                                send notifications about datagram issues back to the sender, handling query and error
                                reporting messages.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        offers two main protocols:
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):</b> TCP provides reliable and ordered data
                                transmission with connection setup. It ensures that data is delivered accurately and in
                                the correct order. TCP operates as a connection-oriented protocol, establishing a
                                connection before data transmission.</li>
                            <li><b>User Datagram Protocol (UDP):</b> UDP offers fast, connectionless data transmission
                                without reliability guarantees. It is suitable for applications where speed is
                                prioritized over reliability. UDP adds basic port addresses, checksum error control, and
                                length information to the upper-layer data.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Additionally, a newer protocol called Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) has been
                        introduced to cater to the needs of certain modern applications, combining features of both TCP
                        and UDP.</li>
                    <li>These protocols within the transport layer play a critical role in managing how data is
                        delivered, ensuring reliability, and accommodating various communication needs.</li>

                        <strong>How Does It Work?</strong><br>
                        Each signal or data stream is assigned a specific frequency band. These bands do not overlap,
                        ensuring that each signal can be transmitted without interference.

                        <strong>What is Wavelength Multiplexing?</strong><br>
                        Wavelength multiplexing is used in optical networks and involves combining multiple optical
                        signals
                        of different wavelengths (colors) onto a single optical fiber.

                        <strong>Why Is It Useful?</strong><br>
                        This technique significantly increases the capacity and speed of data transmission in optical
                        communication systems, making it ideal for high-speed data transfer.

                        <strong>What is Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)?</strong><br>
                        TDM divides a communication channel into discrete time slots. Each connected device or data
                        stream
                        is allocated a specific time slot during which it can transmit data.

                        <strong>Synchronous vs. Asynchronous TDM:</strong><br>
                        - <em>Synchronous TDM:</em> Time slots are fixed and regular, ensuring equal time for each
                        source.<br>
                        - <em>Asynchronous TDM:</em> Time slots are allocated dynamically based on demand, which can be
                        more
                        flexible for varying data rates.

            <h3>Define multiplexing. Discuss frequency division multiplexing with a suitable example.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiplexing is a technique used in telecommunications and data communication to combine multiple
                    signals or data streams into a single transmission medium, such as a cable or a wireless channel.
                    The purpose of multiplexing is to efficiently utilize the available bandwidth and enable multiple
                    signals to share the same communication channel without interfering with each other.</li>
                <li>Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) is one of the common multiplexing techniques. In FDM, the
                    available bandwidth of the communication channel is divided into multiple non-overlapping frequency
                    bands or channels. Each signal or data stream is assigned a specific frequency band within the
                    channel, and the signals are transmitted simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Here's how Frequency Division Multiplexing works with a suitable example:
                    <br>
                    Example: Radio Broadcasting

                    <br>
                    Radio broadcasting is a classic example of Frequency Division Multiplexing. In this scenario:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frequency Bands: The entire radio spectrum, from low-frequency (LF) to very high frequency
                            (VHF) and beyond, is divided into various frequency bands or channels. Each channel
                            represents a specific range of frequencies. For instance, FM radio stations typically
                            operate in the VHF band.</li>
                        <li>Multiple Radio Stations: Multiple radio stations want to broadcast their content
                            simultaneously without interfering with each other. Each radio station is assigned a unique
                            frequency channel within the available bandwidth.</li>
                        <li>Separate Signals: Each radio station generates its audio signal, encodes it, and modulates
                            it onto its allocated carrier frequency. These carrier frequencies are carefully selected to
                            ensure they are non-overlapping and do not interfere with each other.</li>
                        <li>Simultaneous Transmission: All the radio stations transmit their modulated carrier signals
                            simultaneously. As long as they use different carrier frequencies (channels), their signals
                            can coexist in the same communication medium without interference.</li>
                        <li>Receiver Tuning: When a listener tunes their radio receiver to a specific station, the
                            receiver's tuner is adjusted to select the desired carrier frequency (channel). This allows
                            the receiver to isolate and demodulate the signal of the chosen station while rejecting
                            signals from other stations operating on different channels.</li>
                        <li>Audio Output: The listener hears the audio content of the selected radio station through
                            their receiver's speakers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Frequency Division Multiplexing allows multiple radio stations to share the same broadcasting medium
                    (the radio spectrum) efficiently. Each station gets its dedicated frequency channel, ensuring that
                    their signals do not interfere with each other, and listeners can tune in to the station of their
                    choice.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Number of Cables Needed = (n * (n - 1)) / 2</li>
                <li>Number of Ports Required for Each Device = n - 1</li>
                <li>Where "n" is the number of devices in mesh topology.</li>

            <p>In this case:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number of Cables Needed = (6 * (6 - 1)) / 2 = (6 * 5) / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15 cables.</li>

            <h3>LAN (Local Area Network)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>A LAN, or Local Area Network, is a network of interconnected computers, devices, or systems within a
                    limited geographic area, such as a home, office building, or campus. LANs are designed to facilitate
                    the sharing of resources, data, and communication among devices in close proximity. LANs are
                    characterized by high data transfer rates, low latency, and private ownership or control.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Different Topologies for Designing LANs:</h3>
            <ul>

                    <h3>Star Topology:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. All data traffic
                            passes through the central hub, which manages the connections.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A small office network with computers connected to a central
                            network switch.</li>

                    <h3>Bus Topology:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable (the bus). Data is
                            transmitted along the cable, and each device listens for its address.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Legacy Ethernet networks, which used a single coaxial cable for
                            data transmission.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>In a ring topology, devices are connected in a closed loop. Data circulates around the ring
                            until it reaches its destination.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Some early token ring networks used a ring topology.</li>
                        <img src="../../images/ringtopo1.svg" alt="" class="wb">

                    <h3>Mesh Topology:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a mesh topology, every device is connected to every other device. This redundancy
                            provides fault tolerance and multiple paths for data.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> Data centers and critical infrastructure networks.</li>
                        <img src="../../images/meshtopo.svg" alt="" class="wb">

                    <h3>Hybrid Topology:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A hybrid topology combines two or more of the above topologies to create a more flexible and
                            resilient network.</li>
                        <li><strong>Example:</strong> A large campus network with multiple buildings might use a
                            combination of star and ring topologies.</li>
